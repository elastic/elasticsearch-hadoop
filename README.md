# ElasticSearch Hadoop
Read and write data to/from ElasticSearch within Hadoop/MapReduce libraries. Automatically converts data to/from JSON. Supports [MapReduce](#mapreduce), [Cascading](#cascading), [Hive](#hive) and [Pig](#pig).

# Requirements
ElasticSearch cluster accessible through [REST][]. That's it!
Significant effort has been invested to create a small, dependency-free, self-contained jar that can be downloaded and put to use without any dependencies. Simply make it available to your job classpath and you're set.

# License
This project is released under version 2.0 of the [Apache License][]

# Installation
We're working towards a first release and we plan to publish nightly builds soon. In the meantime, please [build](#building-the-source) the project yourself. 
We do build and test the code on _each_ commit; see the current status [here](http://build.elasticsearch.org/browse/ESHADOOP)

# Feedback / Q&A
We're interested in your feedback! You can find us on the User [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/elasticsearch) - please append `[Hadoop]` to the post subject to filter it out. For more details, see the [community](http://www.elasticsearch.org/community/) page.

# Usage

## Configuration Properties

All configuration properties start with `es` prefix. Note that the `es.internal` namespace is reserved for the library internal use and should _not_ be used by the user at any point.

The properties are read mainly from the Hadoop configuration but the user can specify (some of) them directly depending on the library used (see the relevant documentation below). The full list is available [here](http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-hadoop/tree/master/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/hadoop/cfg/ConfigurationOptions.java).

### Required
```
es.resource=<ES resource location, relative to the host/port specified above. Can be an index or a query>
```
### Optional
```
es.host=<ES host address> 				       # defaults to localhost
es.port=<ES REST port>    				       # defaults to 9200
es.bulk.size.bytes=<bulk size in bytes>        # defaults to 10mb
es.bulk.size.entries=<bulk size in entries>    # defaults to 0 (meaning it's not set)
es.http.timeout=<timeout for http connections> # defaults to 1m
```

## [MapReduce][]
For basic, low-level or performance-sensitive environments, ES-Hadoop provides dedicated `InputFormat` and `OutputFormat` that read and write data to ElasticSearch. To use them, add the `es-hadoop` jar to your job classpath
(either by bundling the library along - it's less then 40kB and there are no-dependencies), using the [DistributedCache][] or by provisioning the cluster manually.

Note that es-hadoop supports both the so-called 'old' and the 'new' API through its `ESInputFormat` and `ESOutputFormat` classes.

### 'Old' (`org.apache.hadoop.mapred`) API

### Reading
To read data from ES, configure the `ESInputFormat` on your job configuration along with the relevant [properties](#configuration-properties):
```java
JobConf conf = new JobConf();
conf.setInputFormat(ESInputFormat.class);
conf.set("es.resource", "radio/artists/_search?q=me*"); // replace this with the relevant query
...
JobClient.runJob(conf);
```
### Writing
Same configuration template can be used for writing but using `ESOuputFormat`:
```java
JobConf conf = new JobConf();
conf.setOutputFormat(ESOutputFormat.class);
conf.set("es.resource", "radio/artists"); // index or indices used for storing data
...
JobClient.runJob(conf);
```
### 'New' (`org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce`) API

### Reading
```java
Configuration conf = new Configuration();
conf.set("es.resource", "radio/artists/_search?q=me*"); // replace this with the relevant query
Job job = new Job(conf)
job.setInputFormat(ESInputFormat.class);
...
job.waitForCompletion(true);
```
### Writing
```java
Configuration conf = new Configuration();
conf.set("es.resource", "radio/artists"); // index or indices used for storing data
Job job = new Job(conf)
job.setOutputFormat(ESOutputFormat.class);
...
job.waitForCompletion(true);
```
## [Hive][]
ES-Hadoop provides a Hive storage handler for ElasticSearch, meaning one can define an [external table][] on top of ES.

Add es-hadoop-<version>.jar to `hive.aux.jars.path` or register it manually in your Hive script (recommended):
```
ADD JAR /path_to_jar/es-hadoop-<version>.jar;
```
### Reading
To read data from ES, define a table backed by the desired index:
```SQL
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE artists (
    id      BIGINT,
    name    STRING,
    links   STRUCT<url:STRING, picture:STRING>)
STORED BY 'org.elasticsearch.hadoop.hive.ESStorageHandler'
TBLPROPERTIES('es.resource' = 'radio/artists/_search?q=me*');
```
The fields defined in the table are mapped to the JSON when communicating with ElasticSearch. Notice the use of `TBLPROPERTIES` to define the location, that is the query used for reading from this table:
```
SELECT * FROM artists;
```

### Writing
To write data, a similar definition is used but with a different `es.resource`:
```SQL
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE artists (
    id      BIGINT,
    name    STRING,
    links   STRUCT<url:STRING, picture:STRING>)
STORED BY 'org.elasticsearch.hadoop.hive.ESStorageHandler'
TBLPROPERTIES('es.resource' = 'radio/artists/');
```

Any data passed to the table is then passed down to ElasticSearch; for example considering a table `s`, mapped to a TSV/CSV file, one can index it to ElasticSearch like this:
```SQL
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE artists 
    SELECT NULL, s.name, named_struct('url', s.url, 'picture', s.picture) FROM source s;
```

As one can note, currently the reading and writing are treated separately but we're working on unifying the two and automatically translating [HiveQL][] to ElasticSearch queries.

## [Pig][]
ES-Hadoop provides both read and write functions for Pig so you can access ElasticSearch from Pig scripts.

Register ES-Hadoop jar into your script or add it to your Pig classpath:
```
REGISTER /path_to_jar/es-hadoop-<version>.jar;
```
Additionally one can define an alias to save some chars:
```
%define ESSTORAGE org.elasticsearch.hadoop.pig.ESStorage()
```
and use `$ESSTORAGE` for storage definition.

### Reading
To read data from ES, use `ESStorage` and specify the query through the `LOAD` function:
```
A = LOAD 'radio/artists/_search?q=me*' USING org.elasticsearch.hadoop.pig.ESStorage();
DUMP A;
```

### Writing
Use the same `Storage` to write data to ElasticSearch:
```
A = LOAD 'src/test/resources/artists.dat' USING PigStorage() AS (id:long, name, url:chararray, picture: chararray);
B = FOREACH A GENERATE name, TOTUPLE(url, picture) AS links;
STORE B INTO 'radio/artists' USING org.elasticsearch.hadoop.pig.ESStorage();
```

## [Cascading][]
ES-Hadoop offers a dedicate ElasticSearch [Tap][], `ESTap` that can be used both as a sink or a source. Note that `ESTap` can be used in both local (`LocalFlowConnector`) and Hadoop (`HadoopFlowConnector`) flows:

### Reading
```java
Tap in = new ESTap("radio/artists/_search?q=me*");
Tap out = new StdOut(new TextLine());
new LocalFlowConnector().connect(in, out, new Pipe("read-from-ES")).complete();
```
### Writing
```java
Tap in = Lfs(new TextDelimited(new Fields("id", "name", "url", "picture")), "src/test/resources/artists.dat");
Tap out = new ESTap("radio/artists", new Fields("name", "url", "picture"));
new HadoopFlowConnector().connect(in, out, new Pipe("write-to-ES")).complete();
```

# Building the source

ElasticSearch Hadoop uses [Gradle][] for its build system and it is not required to have it installed on your machine.

To create a distributable jar, run `gradlew -x test build` from the command line; once completed you will find the jar in `build\libs`.
