# Elasticsearch on YARN

## :warning: Elasticsearch on YARN has been discontinued

Due to the limitations in YARN regarding long running services, we have decided to discontinue our development and 
support of the _Elasticsearch on YARN_ beta as of ES-Hadoop 6.0.0. For more information about the removal, please see 
the [deprecation notice on Github](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-hadoop/issues/1000), or join the [discussion
topic](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/deprecation-notice-old-mr-apis-and-es-yarn/92860/3) on our forums. If you are 
searching for _Elasticsearch on YARN_ documentation, you can find the documentation for the last released beta version 
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/hadoop/5.6/es-yarn.html).
