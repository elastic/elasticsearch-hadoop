/**
 * All classes in org.elasticsearch.hadoop.gradle.buildtools are originally
 * copied from the elasticsearch build-tools project. These classes are
 * considered internal in build tools and will not be supported by the build tools
 * team and also not being published in upcoming build tool releases.
 * This will make it easier to build tools team to move forward and distinct explicitly
 * between internal and shared and published build logic to be used by external
 * elasticsearch plugins.
 *
 * We'll revisit these classes here and adjust as the dedicated public build tools plugins
 * evolve over time.
