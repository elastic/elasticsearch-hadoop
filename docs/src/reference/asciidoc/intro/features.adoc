== Key features

The key features of {eh} include:

Scalable {mr} model:: {eh} is built around {mr}: _every_ operation done in {eh} results in multiple Hadoop tasks (based on the number of target shards) that interact, in parallel with {es}.

REST based:: {eh} uses {es} REST interface for communication, allowing for flexible deployments by minimizing the number of ports needed to be open within a network.

Self contained:: the library has been designed to be small and efficient. At around 150KB and _no_ extra dependencies outside Hadoop itself, distributing {eh} within your cluster is simple and fast.

////
Memory/IO Efficient:: {eh} is focused on performance. From pull-based parsing, to bulk updates and direct conversion to native types, {eh} keeps its memory and network IO usage.
////

{mr} API support:: At its core, {eh} uses the low-level {mr} API to read and write data to {es} allowing for maximum integration flexibility and performance.

Facilitates data co-location:: {eh} fully integrates with Hadoop exposing its network access information, allowing co-located {es} and Hadoop clusters to be aware of each other and reduce network IO.

Both 'old'(`mapred`) & 'new'(`mapreduce`) {mr} APIs supported:: {eh} automatically adjusts to your environment; one does not have to change between using the `mapred` or `mapreduce` APIs - both are supported, by the same classes, at the same time.

Cascading support:: Cascading is an application framework for Java developers to simply develop robust applications on Apache Hadoop. And with {eh}, Cascading can run its flows directly onto {es}.

Pig support:: {eh} supports Apache Pig exposing {es} as a _native_ Pig `Storage`. Run your Pig scripts against {es} without any modifications to your configuration or the Pig client.

Hive support:: Run Hive queries against {es} for advanced analystics and _real_time_ reponses. {eh} exposes {es} as a Hive table so your scripts can crunch through data faster then ever.
