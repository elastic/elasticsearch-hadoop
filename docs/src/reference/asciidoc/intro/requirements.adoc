Before running {eh}, please do check out the requirements below. This is even more so important when deploying {eh} across a cluster where the software on some machines might be slightly out of sync. While {eh} tries its best to fall back and do various validations of its environment, doing a quick sanity check especially during upgrades can save you a lot of headaches.

NOTE: make sure to verify *all* nodes in a cluster when checking the version of a certain artifact.

== Requirements

{eh} adds no extra requirements to Hadoop (or the various libraries built on top of it, such as Cascading or Pig) or {es} however as a rule of thumb, do use the latest stable version of the said library (checking the compatibility with Hadoop and the JDK, where applicable).

=== JDK

JDK level 6.0 (or above) just like Hadoop. We strongly recommend using the latest JDK 6.0 - currently update 45, or if possible, JDK 7.0 - currently update 25.

One can check the available JDK version from the command line:

[source,bash]
----
$ java -version
java version "1.6.0_45"
----

=== {es}

version *0.90* or higher (currently 0.90.3) is needed to run {es}. Using a lower version is not possible as {eh} uses new features added in 0.90 for distributed, parallel interactions with {es}.

The {es} version is shown in its folder name:

[source,bash]
----
$ ls
elasticsearch-0.90.3
----

If {es} is running (locally or remotely), one can find out through REST its version:

[source,js]
----
$ curl -XGET http://localhost:9200
{
  "ok" : true,
  "status" : 200,
  "name" : "Sergeant Fury",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "0.90.3",
    "snapshot_build" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "4.3.1"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
----


=== Hadoop

Hadoop 1.x (ideally the latest stable versions in the 1.x line, currently 1.1.2 or 1.2.1). {eh} is tested daily against Apache Hadoop; any distro compatible with Apache Hadoop should work just fine.
If that is not the case, please drop us a line to see what we can do to fix that.

To check the version of Hadoop, one can refer either to its folder or jars (which contain the version in their names) or from the command line:

[source, bash]
----
$ bin/hadoop version
Hadoop 1.2.1
----

=== YARN / Hadoop 2.x

{eh} can run on Yarn / Hadoop 2.x but considering its *alpha* status, it is not recommended for production use.
Since YARN breaks binary backwards compatibility with Hadoop 1.x, a dedicated {eh} needs to be used.
See the <<download>> section for more information.

=== Cascading

Version 2.1.x (currently 2.1.6) is required.

Since Cascading is a library, the best way to find out the target version is to look at its file name:

[source, bash]
----
$ ls
cascading-2.1.6.jar
----

=== Hive

Hive 0.9 or higher. We recommend using the latest release of Hive (currently 0.11.0).

One can find out the Hive version from its folder name or command-line:

[source, bash]
----
$ bin/hive -version
Hive version 0.11.0
----

=== Pig

Pig 0.10.0 or higher. We recommend using the latest release of Pig (currently 0.11.1).

In a similar fashion, Pig version can be discovered from its folder path or through the command-line:

[source, bash]
----
$ bin/pig -i
Apache Pig version 0.11.1
----
