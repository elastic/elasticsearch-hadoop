[[configuration]]
== Configuration

{eh} behavior can be customized through the properties below, typically by setting them on the target job's Hadoop `Configuration`. However some of them can be specified through other means depending on the library used (see the relevant section).

****
{eh} uses the same conventions and reasonable defaults as {es} so you can try it out without bothering with the configuration. Most of the time, these defaults are just fine for running a production cluster; if you are fine-tunning your cluster or wondering about the effect of certain configuration options, please _do ask_ for more information.
****

NOTE: All configuration properties start with the `es` prefix. The namespace `es.internal` is reserved by the library for its internal use and should _not_ be used by the user at any point.

[float]
=== Required settings

`es.resource`::
{es} resource location, where data is read _and_ written to. Requires the format `<index>/<type>` (relative to the {es} host/port (see <<cfg-network,below>>))).

[source,ini]
----
es.resource = twitter/tweet   # index 'twitter', type 'tweet'
----

`es.resource.read` (defaults to `es.resource`)::
{es} resource used for reading (but not writing) data. Useful when reading and writing data to different {es} indices within the _same_ job. Typically set automatically (except for the {mr} module which requires manual configuration).

`es.resource.write`(defaults to `es.resource`)::
{es} resource used for writing (but not reading) data. Used typically for __dynamic resource__ writes or when writing and reading data to different {es} indices within the _same_ job. Typically set automatically (except for the {mr} module which requires manual configuration).

Note that specifying https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/multi-index-multi-type.html[multiple]
indices and/or types in the above resource settings are allowed *only* for reading. Specifying multiple indices for
writes is only supported through the use of dynamic resource (described <<cfg-multi-writes, below>>). Use `_all/types`
to search `types` in all indices or `index/` to search all types within `index`. Do note that reading multiple
indices/types typically works only when they have the same structure and only with some libraries. Integrations that
require a strongly typed mapping (such as a table like Hive or SparkSQL) are likely to fail.

[[cfg-multi-writes]]
[float]
===== Dynamic/multi resource writes

For writing, {eh} allows the target resource to be resolved at runtime by using patterns (by using the `{<field-name>}` format), resolved at runtime based on the data being streamed to {es}. That is, one can save documents to a certain `index` or `type` based on one or multiple fields resolved from the document about to be saved.

For example, assuming the following document set (described here in JSON for readability - feel free to translate this into the actual Java objects):

[source,json]
----
{
    "media_type":"game",
    "title":"Final Fantasy VI",
    "year":"1994"
},
{
    "media_type":"book",
    "title":"Harry Potter",
    "year":"2010"
},
{
    "media_type":"music",
    "title":"Surfing With The Alien",
    "year":"1987"
}
----

to index each of them based on their `media_type` one would use the following pattern:

[source,ini]
----
# index the documents based on their type
es.resource.write = my-collection/{media_type}
----

which would result in `Final Fantasy VI` indexed under `my-collection/game`, `Harry Potter` under `my-collection/book` and `Surfing With The Alien` under `my-collection/music`.
For more information, please refer to the dedicated integration section.

IMPORTANT: Dynamic resources are supported _only_ for writing, for doing multi-index/type reads, use an appropriate {ref}/search-search.html[search query].

[[cfg-multi-writes-format]]
[float]
===== Formatting dynamic/multi resource writes

When using dynamic/multi writes, one can also specify a formatting of the value returned by the field. Out of the box, {eh} provides formatting for date/timestamp fields which is useful for automatically grouping time-based data (such as logs)
 within a certain time range under the same index. By using the Java http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html[SimpleDataFormat] syntax, one can format and parse the date in a locale-sensitive manner.

For example assuming the data contains a +@timestamp+ field, one can group the documents in _daily_ indices using the following configuration:

[source,ini]
----
# index the documents based on their date
es.resource.write = my-collection/{@timestamp|yyyy.MM.dd} <1>
----

<1> +@timestamp+ field formatting - in this case +yyyy.MM.dd+

The same configuration property is used (+es.resource.write+) however, through the special +|+ characters a formatting pattern is specified.
Please refer to the http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html[SimpleDateFormat] javadocs for more information on the syntax supported.
In this case +yyyy.MM.dd+ translates the date into the year (specified by four digits), month by 2 digits followed by the day by two digits (such as +2015.01.28+).

http://logstash.net/[Logstash] users will find this _pattern_ quite http://logstash.net/docs/latest/filters/date[familiar].

[float]
=== Essential settings

[[cfg-network]]
[float]
==== Network
`es.nodes` (default localhost)::
List of {es} nodes to connect to. When using {es} remotely, _do_ set this option. Note that the list does _not_ have to contain _every_ node inside the {es} cluster; these are discovered automatically by {eh} by default (see below). Each node can also have its HTTP/REST port specified individually (e.g. `mynode:9600`).

`es.port` (default 9200)::
Default HTTP/REST port used for connecting to {es} - this setting is applied to the nodes in `es.nodes` that do not have any port specified.

added[2.2]
`es.nodes.path.prefix` (default empty)::
Prefix to add to _all_ requests made to {es}. Useful in environments where the cluster is proxied/routed under a certain path. For example, if the cluster is located at +someaddress:someport/custom/path/prefix+, one would set +es.nodes.path.prefix+ to +/custom/path/prefix+.

[float]
==== Querying
`es.query` (default none)::
Holds the query used for reading data from the specified `es.resource`. By default it is not set/empty, meaning the entire data under the specified index/type is returned.
`es.query` can have three forms:

uri query;;
using the form `?uri_query`, one can specify a {ref}/search-uri-request.html[query string]. Notice the leading `?`.

query dsl;;
using the form `query_dsl` - note the query dsl needs to start with `{` and end with `}` as mentioned {ref}/search-request-body.html[here]

external resource;;
if none of the two above do match, {eh} will try to interpret the parameter as a path within the HDFS file-system. If that is not the case, it will try to load the resource from the classpath or, if that fails, from the Hadoop `DistributedCache`. The resource should contain either a `uri query` or a `query dsl`.

To wit, here is an example:
[source,ini]
----
# uri (or parameter) query
es.query = ?q=costinl

# query dsl
es.query = { "query" : { "term" : { "user" : "costinl" } } }

# external resource
es.query = org/mypackage/myquery.json
----

In other words, `es.query` is flexible enough so that you can use whatever search api you prefer, either inline or by loading it from an external resource.

TIP: We recommend using query dsl externalized in a file, included within the job jar (and thus available on its classpath). This makes it easy
to identify, debug and organize your queries.
Through-out the documentation we use the uri query to save text and increase readability - real-life queries quickly become unwieldy when used as uris.

[float]
==== Operation

`es.input.json` (default false)::
Whether the input is already in JSON format or not (the default). Please see the appropriate section of each
integration for more details about using JSON directly.

`es.write.operation` (default index)::
The write operation {eh} should perform - can be any of:
`index` (default);; new data is added while existing data (based on its id) is replaced (reindexed).
`create`;; adds new data - if the data already exists (based on its id), an exception is thrown.
`update`;; updates existing data (based on its id). If no data is found, an exception is thrown.
`upsert`;; known as _merge_ or insert if the data does not exist, updates if the data exists (based on its id).

added[2.1]
`es.output.json` (default false)::
Whether the output from the connector should be in JSON format or not (the default). When enabled, the documents are returned in raw JSON format (as returned
from {es}). Please see the appropriate section of each integration for more details about using JSON directly.

added[5.0.0]
`es.ingest.pipeline` (default none)::
The name of an existing {es} Ingest pipeline that should be targeted when indexing or creating documents. Only usable when doing `index` and `create` operations; Incompatible with `update` or `upsert` operations.

[float]
[[cfg-mapping]]
==== Mapping (when writing to {es})

`es.mapping.id` (default none)::
The document field/property name containing the document id.

`es.mapping.parent` (default none)::
The document field/property name containing the document parent. To specify a constant, use the `<CONSTANT>` format.

added[5.6.0]
`es.mapping.join` (default none)::
The document field/property name containing the document's join field. Constants are not accepted. Join fields on a
document must contain either the parent relation name as a string, or an object that contains the child relation name
and the id of its parent. If a child document is identified when using this setting, the document's routing is
automatically set to the parent id if no other routing is configured in `es.mapping.routing`.

`es.mapping.routing` (default depends on +es.mapping.join+)::
The document field/property name containing the document routing. To specify a constant, use the `<CONSTANT>` format.
If a join field is specified with `es.mapping.join`, then this defaults to the value of the join field's parent id. If
a join field is not specified, then this defaults to none.

`es.mapping.version` (default none)::
The document field/property name containing the document version. To specify a constant, use the `<CONSTANT>` format.

`es.mapping.version.type` (default depends on +es.mapping.version+)::
Indicates the {ref}/docs-index_.html#index-version-types[type of versioning] used.
If +es.mapping.version+ is undefined (default), its value is unspecified. If +es.mapping.version+ is specified, its value becomes +external+.

deprecated[6.0.0]
`es.mapping.ttl` (default none)::
The document field/property name containing the document time-to-live. To specify a constant, use the `<CONSTANT>` format.
Will not work on Elasticsearch 6.0+ index versions, but support will continue for 5.x index versions and below.

deprecated[6.0.0]
`es.mapping.timestamp` (default none)::
The document field/property name containing the document timestamp. To specify a constant, use the `<CONSTANT>` format.
Will not work on Elasticsearch 6.0+ index versions, but support will continue for 5.x index versions and below.

added[2.1]
`es.mapping.include` (default none)::
Field/property to be included in the document sent to {es}. Useful for _extracting_ the needed data from entities. The syntax is similar
to that of {es} {ref}/search-request-body.html#request-body-search-source-filtering[include/exclude].
Multiple values can be specified by using a comma. By default, no value is specified meaning all properties/fields are included.

IMPORTANT: The `es.mapping.include` feature is ignored when `es.input.json` is specified. In order to prevent the connector from indexing
data that is implicitly excluded, any jobs with these property conflicts will refuse to execute!

added[2.1]
`es.mapping.exclude` (default none)::
Field/property to be excluded in the document sent to {es}. Useful for _eliminating_ unneeded data from entities. The syntax is similar
to that of {es} {ref}/search-request-body.html#request-body-search-source-filtering[include/exclude].
Multiple values can be specified by using a comma. By default, no value is specified meaning no properties/fields are excluded.

IMPORTANT: The `es.mapping.exclude` feature is ignored when `es.input.json` is specified. In order to prevent the connector from indexing
data that is explicitly excluded, any jobs with these property conflicts will refuse to execute!

For example:
[source,ini]
----
# extracting the id from the field called 'uuid'
es.mapping.id = uuid

# specifying a parent with id '123'
es.mapping.parent = \<123>

# combine include / exclude for complete control
# include
es.mapping.include = u*, foo.*
# exclude
es.mapping.exclude = *.description
----

Using the configuration above, each entry will have only its top-level fields, starting with +u+ and nested fields under +foo+ included
in the document with the exception of any nested field named +description+. Additionally the document parent will be +123+ while the
document id extracted from field +uuid+.


[float]
[[cfg-field-info]]
==== Field information (when reading from {es})

added[2.1]
`es.mapping.date.rich` (default true)::
Whether to create a _rich_ +Date+ like object for +Date+ fields in {es} or returned them as primitives (+String+ or +long+). By default this is
true. The actual object type is based on the library used; noteable exception being Map/Reduce which provides no built-in +Date+ object and as such
+LongWritable+ and +Text+ are returned regardless of this setting.

added[2.2]
`es.read.field.include` (default empty)::
Fields/properties that are parsed and considered when reading the documents from {es}. By default empty meaning all fields are considered. Use this property with _caution_
as it can have nasty side-effects. Typically used in cases where some documents returned do not fit into an expected mapping.

added[2.2]
`es.read.field.exclude` (default empty)::
Fields/properties that are discarded when reading the documents from {es}. By default empty meaning no fields are excluded. Use this property with _caution_
as it can have nasty side-effects. Typically used in cases where some documents returned do not fit into an expected mapping.

For example:
[source,ini]
----
# To exclude field company.income
es.read.field.exclude = company.income
----

added[2.2]
`es.read.field.as.array.include` (default empty)::
Fields/properties that should be considered as arrays/lists. Since {es} can map one or multiple values to a field, {eh} cannot determine from the mapping
whether to treat a field on a document as a single value or an array. When encountering multiple values, {eh} automatically reads
the field into the appropriate array/list type for an integration, but in strict mapping scenarios (like Spark SQL) this
may lead to problems (an array is encountered when Spark's Catalyst engine expects a single value).
The syntax for this setting is similar to that of {es} {ref}/search-request-body.html#request-body-search-source-filtering[include/exclude].
Multiple values can be specified by using a comma. By default, no value is specified, meaning no fields/properties are treated as arrays.

NOTE: Not all fields need to specify `es.read.field.as.array` to be treated as an array. Fields of type `nested` are always
treated as an array of objects and should not be marked under `es.read.field.as.array.include`.

For example, given the document:
[source,json]
----
{
  "foo": {
    "bar": [ "abc", "def" ]
  }
}
----

Use the following configuration:
[source,ini]
----
# mapping foo.bar as an array
es.read.field.as.array.include = foo.bar
----

If your document contains multiple levels of arrays:
[source,json]
----
{
  "foo": {
    "bar": [[["abc", "def"], ["ghi", "jkl"]], [["mno", "pqr"], ["stu", "vwx"]]]
  }
}
----

Then specify the dimensionality of the array in the configuration:
[source,ini]
----
# mapping foo.bar as a 3-level/dimensional array
es.read.field.as.array.include = foo.bar:3
----

`es.read.field.as.array.exclude` (default empty)::
Fields/properties that should not be considered as arrays/lists. Similar to `es.read.field.as.array.include` above. Multiple values can be specified by using a comma.
By default, no value is specified meaning no properties/fields are excluded (and since none is included as indicated above), no field is treated as array
before-hand. Note that this setting does not affect nested fields as they are always considered to be arrays.

[float]
==== Metadata (when reading from {es})

+es.read.metadata+ (default false)::
Whether to include the document metadata (such as id and version) in the results or not (default).

+es.read.metadata.field+ (default _metadata)::
The field under which the metadata information is placed. When +es.read.metadata+ is set to true, the information is returned as a +Map+ under the specified field.

+es.read.metadata.version+ (default false)::
Whether to include the document version in the returned metadata. Applicable only if +es.read.metadata+ is enabled.


[float]
[[cfg-update]]
==== Update settings (when writing to {es})

One using the `update` or `upsert` operation, additional settings (that mirror the {ref}/docs-update.html[update] API) are available:

`es.update.script.inline` (default none)::
Inline Script used for updating the document.

added[6.0]
`es.update.script.file` (default none)::
Name of file script to use for updating document. File scripts are removed in 6.x, and as such, this property will throw
an error if used against a 6.x and above cluster.

added[6.0]
`es.update.script.stored` (default none)::
Identifier of a stored script to use for updating the document.

`es.update.script.lang` (default none)::
Script language. By default, no value is specified applying the node configuration.

`es.update.script.params` (default none)::
Script parameters (if any). The document (currently read) field/property who's value is used. To specify a constant, use the `<CONSTANT>` format.
Multiple values can be specified through commas (`,`)

For example:
[source,ini]
----
# specifying 2 parameters, one extracting the value from field 'number', the other containing the value '123':
es.update.script.params = param1:number,param2:\<123>
----

`es.update.script.params.json`::
Script parameters specified in `raw`, JSON format. The specified value is passed as is, without any further processing or filtering. Typically used for migrating existing update scripts.

For example:
[source,ini]
----
es.update.script.params.json = {"param1":1, "param2":2}
----

`es.update.retry.on.conflict` (default 0)::
How many times an update to a document is retried in case of conflict. Useful in concurrent environments.

[float]
=== Advanced settings

[[configuration-options-index]]
[float]
==== Index

`es.index.auto.create` (default yes)::
Whether {eh} should create an index (if its missing) when writing data to {es} or fail.

`es.index.read.missing.as.empty` (default no)::
Whether {eh} will allow reading of non existing indices (and return an empty data set) or not (and throw an exception)

`es.field.read.empty.as.null` (default yes)::
Whether {eh} will treat empty fields as `null`. This settings is typically not needed (as {eh} already handles the
null case) but is enabled for making it easier to work with text fields that haven't been sanitized yet.

`es.field.read.validate.presence` (default warn)::
To help out spot possible mistakes when querying data from Hadoop (which results in incorrect data being returned), {eh} can perform validation spotting missing fields and potential typos. Possible values are :
`ignore`;; no validation is performed
`warn`;; a warning message is logged in case the validation fails
`strict`;; an exception is thrown, halting the job, if a field is missing

The default (`warn`) will log any typos to the console when the job starts:

[source,bash]
----
WARN main mr.EsInputFormat - Field(s) [naem, adress] not found
   in the Elasticsearch mapping specified; did you mean [name, location.address]?
----

added[6.6]
`es.read.shard.preference` (default none)::
The value to use for the shard preference of a search operation when executing a scroll query. If left empty, the
connector will automatically sense when to use the `_local` shard preference. This is most useful in hot/cold
architectures when you need direct control over which nodes search operations are executed on:

[source,bash]
----
es.read.shard.preference = _only_nodes:abc*
----

IMPORTANT: {ehtm} makes no attempt to validate this preference setting before running, and incorrectly configured shard
preferences may cause scroll queries to fail in the event that shards cannot be located with the provided preferences.

`es.read.source.filter` (default none)::
Normally when using an integration that allows specifying some form of schema
(such as Hive), the connector will automatically extract the field
names from the schema and request only those fields from {es} to save on bandwidth.
When using an integration that _does not_ leverage any data schemas (such as normal
MR and Spark), this property allows you to specify a comma delimited string of field
names that you would like to return from {es}.

IMPORTANT: If `es.read.source.filter` is set, an exception will be thrown in the
case that the connector tries to push down a different source field filtering.
In these cases you should clear this property and trust that the connector knows
which fields should be returned. This occurs in SparkSQL, Hive, and when
specifying a schema in Pig.

[source,bash]
----
User specified source filters were found [name,timestamp], but the connector is executing in a state where it has provided its own source filtering [name,timestamp,location.address]. Please clear the user specified source fields under the [es.read.source.filter] property to continue. Bailing out...
----

added[5.4]
`es.index.read.allow.red.status` (default false)::
When executing a job that is reading from Elasticsearch, if the resource provided for reads
includes an index that has missing shards that are causing the cluster to have a status of
`red`, then ES-Hadoop will inform you of this status and fail fast. In situations where the
job must continue using the remaining available data that is still reachable, users can
enable this property to instruct the connector to ignore shards it could not reach.

WARNING: Using `es.index.read.allow.red.status` can lead to jobs running over incomplete
datasets. Jobs executed against a red cluster will yield inconsistent results when
compared to jobs executed against a fully green or yellow cluster. Use this setting with
caution.

[float]
==== Input

added[5.0.0]
`es.input.max.docs.per.partition` ::
When reading from an {es} cluster that supports scroll slicing ({es} v5.0.0 and above), this parameter advises the
connector on what the maximum number of documents per input partition should be. The connector will sample and estimate
the number of documents on each shard to be read and divides each shard into input slices using the value supplied by
this property. This property is a suggestion, not a guarantee. The final number of documents per partition is not
guaranteed to be below this number, but rather, they will be close to this number. This property is ignored if you are
reading from an {es} cluster that does not support scroll slicing ({es} any version below v5.0.0). By default, this
value is unset, and the input partitions are calculated based on the number of shards in the indices being read.

[float]
==== Network

`es.nodes.discovery` (default true)::
Whether to discover the nodes within the {es} cluster or only to use the ones given in `es.nodes` for metadata queries. Note that this setting only applies during start-up; afterwards when reading and writing, {eh} uses the target index shards (and their hosting nodes) unless +es.nodes.client.only+ is enabled.

`es.nodes.client.only` (default false)::
Whether to use {es} {ref}/modules-node.html[client nodes] (or _load-balancers_). When enabled, {eh} will route _all_ its requests (after nodes discovery, if enabled) through the _client_ nodes within the cluster. Note this typically significantly reduces the node parallelism and thus it is disabled by default. Enabling it also
disables `es.nodes.data.only` (since a client node is a non-data node).

added[2.1.2]
`es.nodes.data.only` (default true)::
Whether to use {es} {ref}/modules-node.html[data nodes] only. When enabled, {eh} will route _all_ its requests (after nodes discovery, if enabled) through the _data_ nodes within the cluster. The purpose of this configuration setting is to avoid overwhelming non-data nodes as these tend to be "smaller" nodes. This is enabled by default.

added[5.0.0]
`es.nodes.ingest.only` (default false)::
Whether to use {es} {ref}/modules-node.html[ingest nodes] only. When enabled, {eh} will route _all_ of its requests (after nodes discovery, if enabled) through the _ingest_ nodes within the cluster. The purpose of this configuration setting is to avoid incurring the cost of forwarding data meant for a pipeline from non-ingest nodes; Really only useful when writing data to an Ingest Pipeline (see `es.ingest.pipeline` above).

added[2.2]
`es.nodes.wan.only` (default false)::
Whether the connector is used against an {es} instance in a cloud/restricted environment over the WAN, such as Amazon Web Services. In this mode, the connector disables discovery and _only_ connects through the declared +es.nodes+ during all operations, including reads and writes.
Note that in this mode, performance is _highly_  affected.

added[2.2]
`es.nodes.resolve.hostname` (default depends)::
Whether the connector should resolve the nodes hostnames to IP addresses or not. By default it is +true+ unless +wan+ mode is enabled (see above) in which case it will default to false.

added[2.2]
`es.http.timeout` (default 1m)::
Timeout for HTTP/REST connections to {es}.

`es.http.retries` (default 3)::
Number of retries for establishing a (broken) http connection. The retries are applied for each _conversation_ with an {es} node. Once the retries are depleted, the connection will automatically be re-reouted to the next
available {es} node (based on the declaration of `es.nodes`, followed by the discovered nodes - if enabled).

`es.scroll.keepalive` (default 10m)::
The maximum duration of result scrolls between query requests.

`es.scroll.size` (default 1000)::
Number of results/items/documents returned per scroll request on each executor/worker/task.

added[2.2]
`es.scroll.limit` (default -1)::
Number of _total_ results/items returned by each individual scroll. A negative value indicates that all documents that match should be returned. Do note that this applies per scroll which is typically bound to one of the job tasks.
Thus the total number of documents returned is `LIMIT * NUMBER_OF_SCROLLS (OR TASKS)`

`es.action.heart.beat.lead` (default 15s)::
The lead to task timeout before {eh} informs Hadoop the task is still running to prevent task restart.

added[5.3.0]
[float]
==== Setting HTTP Request Headers
`es.net.http.header.[HEADER-NAME]` ::
By using the `es.net.http.header.` prefix, you can provide HTTP Headers to all
requests made to {es} from {eh}. Please note that some standard HTTP Headers are
reserved by the connector to ensure correct operation and cannot be set or overridden
by the user (`Accept` and `Content-Type` for instance).

For example, here the user is setting the `Max-Forwards` HTTP header:

[source,ini]
----
es.net.http.header.Max-Forwards = 10
----

[float]
==== Secure Settings

added[6.4]
`es.keystore.location`:: location of the secure settings keystore file (typically a URL, without a prefix it is interpreted as a classpath entry). See <<keystore>> for more info.

added[2.1]
[float]
==== Basic Authentication

`es.net.http.auth.user`:: Basic Authentication user name
`es.net.http.auth.pass`:: <<keystore,Securable>>. Basic Authentication password

added[2.1]
[float]
==== SSL

`es.net.ssl` (default false):: Enable SSL

`es.net.ssl.keystore.location`:: key store (if used) location (typically a URL, without a prefix it is interpreted as a classpath entry)

`es.net.ssl.keystore.pass`:: <<keystore,Securable>>. key store password

`es.net.ssl.keystore.type` (default JKS):: key store type. PK12 is a common, alternative format

`es.net.ssl.truststore.location`:: trust store location (typically a URL, without a prefix it is interpreted as a classpath entry)

`es.net.ssl.truststore.pass`:: <<keystore,Securable>>. trust store password

`es.net.ssl.cert.allow.self.signed` (default false):: Whether or not to allow self signed certificates

`es.net.ssl.protocol`(default TLS):: SSL protocol to be used

[float]
==== Proxy

`es.net.proxy.http.host`:: Http proxy host name
`es.net.proxy.http.port`:: Http proxy port
`es.net.proxy.http.user`:: Http proxy user name
`es.net.proxy.http.pass`:: <<keystore,Securable>>. Http proxy password
`es.net.proxy.http.use.system.props`(default yes):: Whether the use the system Http proxy properties (namely `http.proxyHost` and `http.proxyPort`) or not

added[2.2]
`es.net.proxy.https.host`:: Https proxy host name

added[2.2]
`es.net.proxy.https.port`:: Https proxy port

added[2.2]
`es.net.proxy.https.user`:: Https proxy user name

added[2.2]
`es.net.proxy.https.pass`:: <<keystore,Securable>>. Https proxy password

added[2.2]
`es.net.proxy.https.use.system.props`(default yes):: Whether the use the system Https proxy properties (namely `https.proxyHost` and `https.proxyPort`) or not

`es.net.proxy.socks.host`:: Http proxy host name
`es.net.proxy.socks.port`:: Http proxy port
`es.net.proxy.socks.user`:: Http proxy user name
`es.net.proxy.socks.pass`:: <<keystore,Securable>>. Http proxy password
`es.net.proxy.socks.use.system.props`(default yes):: Whether the use the system Socks proxy properties (namely `socksProxyHost` and `socksProxyHost`) or not

NOTE: {eh} allows proxy settings to be applied only to its connection using the setting above. Take extra care when there is already a JVM-wide proxy setting (typically through system properties) to avoid unexpected behavior.
IMPORTANT: The semantics of these properties are described in the JVM http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/doc-files/net-properties.html#Proxies[docs]. In some cases, setting up the JVM property `java.net.useSystemProxies`
to `true` works better then setting these properties manually.

[float]
[[configuration-serialization]]
==== Serialization

`es.batch.size.bytes` (default 1mb)::
Size (in bytes) for batch writes using {es} {ref}/docs-bulk.html[bulk] API. Note the bulk size is allocated _per task_ instance. Always multiply by the number of tasks within a Hadoop job to get the total bulk size at runtime hitting {es}.

`es.batch.size.entries` (default 1000)::
Size (in entries) for batch writes using {es} {ref}/docs-bulk.html[bulk] API - (0 disables it). Companion to `es.batch.size.bytes`, once one matches, the batch update is executed. Similar to the size, this setting is _per task_ instance; it gets multiplied at runtime by the total number of Hadoop tasks running.

`es.batch.write.refresh` (default true)::
Whether to invoke an {ref}/indices-refresh.html[index refresh] or not after a bulk update has been completed. Note this is called only after the entire write (meaning multiple bulk updates) have been executed.

`es.batch.write.retry.count` (default 3)::
Number of retries for a given batch in case {es} is overloaded and data is rejected. Note that only the rejected data is retried. If there is still data rejected after the retries have been performed, the Hadoop job is cancelled (and fails). A negative value indicates infinite retries; be careful in setting this value as it can have unwanted side effects.

`es.batch.write.retry.wait` (default 10s)::
Time to wait between batch write retries that are caused by bulk rejections.

`es.ser.reader.value.class` (default _depends on the library used_)::
Name of the `ValueReader` implementation for converting JSON to objects. This is set by the framework depending on the library ({mr}, Hive, Pig, etc...) used.

`es.ser.writer.value.class` (default _depends on the library used_)::
Name of the `ValueWriter` implementation for converting objects to JSON. This is set by the framework depending on the library ({mr}, Hive, Pig, etc...) used.

[[configuration-runtime]]
== Runtime options

When using {eh}, it is important to be aware of the following Hadoop configurations that can influence the way Map/Reduce tasks are executed and in return {eh}.

IMPORTANT: Unfortunately, these settings need to be setup *manually* *before* the job / script configuration. Since {eh} is called too late in the life-cycle, after the tasks have been already dispatched and as such, cannot influence the execution anymore.

[float]
=== Speculative execution

[quote, Yahoo! developer network]
____
As most of the tasks in a job are coming to a close, http://developer.yahoo.com/hadoop/tutorial/module4.html#tolerance[speculative execution] will schedule redundant copies of the remaining tasks across several nodes which do not have other work to perform. Therefore, the same input can be processed multiple times in parallel, to exploit differences in machine capabilities.
____

In other words, speculative execution is an *optimization*, enabled by default, that allows Hadoop to create duplicates tasks of those which it considers hanged or slowed down. When doing data crunching or reading resources, having duplicate tasks is harmless and means at most a waste of computation resources; however when writing data to an external store, this can cause data corruption through duplicates or unnecessary updates.
Since the 'speculative execution' behavior can be triggered by external factors (such as network or CPU load which in turn cause false positive) even in stable environments (virtualized clusters are particularly prone to this) and has a direct impact on data, {eh} disables this optimization for data safety.

Please check your library setting and disable this feature. If you encounter more data then expected, double and triple check this setting.

[float]
==== Disabling Map/Reduce speculative execution

Speculative execution can be disabled for the map and reduce phase - we recommend disabling in both cases - by setting to `false` the following two properties:

`mapred.map.tasks.speculative.execution`
`mapred.reduce.tasks.speculative.execution`

One can either set the properties by name manually on the `Configuration`/`JobConf` client:

[source,java]
----
jobConf.setSpeculativeExecution(false);
// or
configuration.setBoolean("mapred.map.tasks.speculative.execution", false);
configuration.setBoolean("mapred.reduce.tasks.speculative.execution", false);
----

or by passing them as arguments to the command line:

[source,bash]
----
$ bin/hadoop jar -Dmapred.map.tasks.speculative.execution=false \
                 -Dmapred.reduce.tasks.speculative.execution=false <jar>
----

[float]
==== Hive speculative execution

Apache Hive has its own setting for speculative execution through namely `hive.mapred.reduce.tasks.speculative.execution`. It is enabled by default so do change it to `false` in your scripts:

[source,sql]
----
set hive.mapred.reduce.tasks.speculative.execution=false;
----

Note that while the setting has been deprecated in Hive 0.10 and one might get a warning, double check that the speculative execution is actually disabled.

[float]
==== Spark speculative execution

Out of the box, Spark has speculative execution disabled. Double check this is the case through the `spark.speculation` setting (`false` to disable it, `true` to enable it).


[[security]]
== Security

{eh} can work in secure environments and has support for authentication and authorization. However it is important to understand that {eh} per-se is a _connector_, that is, it bridges two different systems. So when talking about security,
it is important to understand to what system it applies: the connector can run within a secure Hadoop environment talking to a vanilla/non-secured {es} cluster. Or vice-versa, it can run within a non-secured Spark environment while talking securely to a {es} cluster. Of course, the opposite can happen as well; the connector running within a secure Hadoop environment and communicating with a secured {es} cluster or the most common use-case, running from an open 
Spark environment to a default, non-secured {es} install.
This enumeration of setups is actually on purpose, to illustrate that based on what piece of the environment is secured, its respective connector configuration needs to be adjusted. 

[float]
=== Secure Hadoop/Spark

As the connector runs as a _library_ within Hadoop or Spark, for the most part it does not require any special configuration as it will _inherit_ and _run_ using the enclosing job/task credentials. In other words, as long as your Hadoop/Spark job is properly configured to run against the secure environment, {eh} as library simply runs within that secured context using the already configured credentials. Settings this up is beyond the purpose of this documentation however it typically boils down to setting up the proper credentials on the configuration object used by the job/task.

[float]
=== Secure {es}

{es} itself can be secured which impacts clients (like {eh} )on two fronts: transport layer which is now encrypted and access layer which requires authentication. Note that typically it is recommended to enable both options (secure transport and secure access).

[float]
==== SSL/TLS configuration

In case of an encrypted transport, the SSL/TLS support needs to be enabled in {eh} in order for the connector to properly communicate with {es}. This is done by setting `es.net.ssl` property to `true` and, depending on your SSL configuration (whether the certificates are signed by a CA or not, whether they are global at JVM level or just local to one application), might require setting up the `keystore` and/or `truststore`, that is where the _credentials_ are stored (`keystore` - which typically stores private keys and certificates) and how to _verify_ them (`truststore` - which typically stores certificates from third party also known as CA - certificate authorities).
Typically (and again, do note that your environment might differ significantly), if the SSL setup for {eh} is not already done at the JVM level, one needs to setup the keystore if the {eh} security requires client authentication (PKI - Public Key Infrastructure), and setup `truststore` if SSL is enabled.

[float]
==== Authentication

The authentication support in {eh} is of two types:

Username/Password:: Set these through `es.net.http.auth.user` and `es.net.http.auth.pass` properties.
PKI/X.509:: Use X.509 certificates to authenticate {eh} to {eh}. For this, one would need to setup the `keystore` containing the private key and certificate to the appropriate user (configured in {es}) and the `truststore` with the CA certificate used to sign the SSL/TLS certificates in the {es} cluster. That is one setup the key to authenticate {eh} and also to verify that is the right one. To do so, one should setup the `es.net.ssl.keystore.location` and `es.net.ssl.truststore.location` properties to indicate the `keystore` and `truststore` to use. It is recommended to have these secured through a password in which case `es.net.ssl.keystore.pass` and `es.net.ssl.truststore.pass` properties are required.

[float]
[[keystore]]
==== Secure Settings
added[6.4.0]

{eh} is configured using settings that sometimes contain sensitive information such as passwords. It may not be
desirable for those property values to appear in the job configuration as plain text. For these situations, {eh} supports
reading some secure properties from a keystore file.

NOTE: The {eh} keystore currently only provides obfuscation. In the future, password protection will be added.

Only the following configurations can be read from the secure settings:
* `es.net.http.auth.pass`
* `es.net.ssl.keystore.pass`
* `es.net.ssl.truststore.pass`
* `es.net.proxy.http.pass`
* `es.net.proxy.https.pass`
* `es.net.proxy.socks.pass`

Provided with {eh} is a keytool program that will allow you to create and add entries to a compatible keystore file.
[source,bash]
----
$> java -classpath path/to/eshadoop.jar org.elasticsearch.hadoop.cli.Keytool <command> <args>
----

To create a keystore file in your working directory, run the `create` command:
[source,bash]
----
$> java -classpath path/to/eshadoop.jar org.elasticsearch.hadoop.cli.Keytool create
$> ls
esh.keystore
----

A list of the settings in the keystore is available with the `list` command:
[source,bash]
----
$> java -classpath path/to/eshadoop.jar org.elasticsearch.hadoop.cli.Keytool list
----

Once a keystore file has been created, your sensitive settings can be added using the `add` command:
[source,bash]
----
$> java -classpath path/to/eshadoop.jar org.elasticsearch.hadoop.cli.Keytool add the.setting.name.to.set
----
A prompt will appear and request the value for the setting. To pass the value through stdin, use the `--stdin` flag:
[source,bash]
----
$> cat /file/containing/setting/value | java -classpath path/to/eshadoop.jar org.elasticsearch.hadoop.cli.Keytool add --stdin the.setting.name.to.set
----

To remove a setting from the keystore, use the `remove` command:
[source,bash]
----
$> java -classpath path/to/eshadoop.jar org.elasticsearch.hadoop.cli.Keytool remove the.setting.name.to.set
----

Once your settings are all specified, you must make sure that the keystore is available on every node. This can
be done by placing it on each node's local file system, or by adding the keystore to the job's classpath. Once the
keystore has been added, its location must be specified with the `es.keystore.location`. To reference a local file,
use a fully qualified file URL (ex `file:///path/to/file`). If the secure store is propagated using the command line, just
use the file's name.

[[logging]]
== Logging

{eh} uses http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-logging/[commons-logging] library, same as Hadoop, for its logging infrastructure and thus it shares the same configuration means. Out of the box, no configuration is required - by default, {eh} logs relevant information about the job progress at `INFO` level. Typically, whatever integration you are using (Map/Reduce, Hive, Pig), each job will print in the console at least one message indicating the {eh} version used:

[source,bash]
----
16:13:01,946  INFO main util.Version - Elasticsearch Hadoop v2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT [f2c5c3e280]
----

Configuring logging for Hadoop (or Hive and Pig) is outside the scope of this documentation, however in short, at runtime, Hadoop relies on http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/[log4j 1.2] as an actual logging implementation. In practice, this means adding the package name of interest and its level logging the `log4j.properties` file in the job classpath.
{eh} provides the following important packages:
[cols="^,^",options="header"]

|===
| Package | Purpose

|`org.elasticsearch.hadoop.hive`            | Apache Hive integration
|`org.elasticsearch.hadoop.mr`              | {mr} functionality
|`org.elasticsearch.hadoop.pig`             | Apache Pig integration
|`org.elasticsearch.hadoop.rest`            | REST/transport infrastructure
|`org.elasticsearch.hadoop.serialization`   | Serialization package
|`org.elasticsearch.spark`                  | Apache Spark package
|`org.elasticsearch.storm`                  | Apache Storm package

|===

The default logging level (`INFO`) is suitable for day-to-day use; if troubleshooting is needed, consider switching to `DEBUG` but be selective of the packages included. For low-level details, enable level `TRACE` however do remember that it will result in a *significant* amount of logging data which _will_ impact your job performance and environment.

To put everything together, if you want to enable `DEBUG` logging on the {mr} package make changes to the `log4j.properties` (used by your environment):

[source,bash]
----
log4j.category.org.elasticsearch.hadoop.mr=DEBUG
----

TIP: See the log4j https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/PropertyConfigurator.html#doConfigure%28java.lang.String,%20org.apache.log4j.spi.LoggerRepository%29[javadoc] for more information.

=== Configure the 'executing' JVM logging not the client

One thing to note is that in almost all cases, one needs to configure logging in the _executing_ JVM, where the Map/Reduce tasks actually run and not on the client, where the job is assembled or monitored. Depending on your library, platform and version this can done through some dedicated settings.
In particular {mr}-based libraries like Pig or Hive can be difficult to configure since at runtime, they create {mr} tasks to actually perform the work. Thus, one needs to configure logging and pass the configuration to the {mr} layer for logging to occur.
In both cases, this can be achieved through the `SET` command. In particular when using Hadoop 2.6, one can use `mapreduce.job.log4j-properties-file` along with an appropriate https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/release-2.6.0/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-nodemanager/src/main/resources/container-log4j.properties[`container-log4j.properties`] file. 
It's worth mentioning that Pig allows jobs to be executed locally and logging to be enabled through `pig -x local -4 myLoggingFile someScript.pig`
