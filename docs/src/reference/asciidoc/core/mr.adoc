[[mapreduce]]
== {mr} integration

For low-level or performance-sensitive environments, {eh} provides dedicated `InputFormat` and `OutputFormat` implementations that can read and write data to {es}.
In {mr}, the ++Mapper++s and ++Reducer++s are reading and writing `Writable` objects, a Hadoop specific interface optimized for serialization. As such, {eh} `InputFormat` and `OutputFormat` will return and expect `MapWritable` objects; A map is used for each document being read or written. The map itself can have any type of internal structure as long as its objects are also `Writable` - it can hold nested maps, numbers or strings in their `Writable` representation.
Internally {eh} automatically converts the `Map` of `Writable` to JSON documents and vice-versa so you do not have to deal with the low-level parsing or conversion to and from JSON. Moreover, if the data sent to {es} is already in JSON format, it can be streamed in directly without any conversion to `Writable` objects.

[float]
=== Installation

In order to use {eh}, the <<install,jar>> needs to be available to the job class path. At ~`250kB` and without any dependencies, the jar can be either bundled in the job archive, manually or through CLI http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/commands_manual.html#Generic`Options[Generic Options] (if your jar implements the http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/api/org/apache/hadoop/util/Tool.html[Tool] interface), be distributed through Hadoop's http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/mapred_tutorial.html#DistributedCache[DistributedCache] or made available by provisioning the cluster manually.

IMPORTANT: All the options above affect _only_ the code running on the distributed nodes. If your code that launches the Hadoop job refers to {eh}, make sure to include the JAR in the `HADOOP_CLASSPATH`:
`HADOOP_CLASSPATH="<colon-separated-paths-to-your-jars-including-elasticsearch-hadoop>"`

.CLI example

[source,bash]
----
$ bin/hadoop jar myJar.jar -libjars elasticsearch-hadoop.jar

[configuration-mr]
[float]
=== Configuration

When using {eh} in a {mr} job, one can use Hadoop's +Configuration+ object to configure {eh} by setting the various options as properties on the aforementioned object.
Typically one would set the {es} host and port (assuming it is not running on the default `localhost:9200`), the target index/type and potentially the query, for example:

[source,java]
----
Configuration conf = new Configuration();
conf.set("es.nodes", "es-server:9200");    <1>
conf.set("es.resource", "radio/artists");  <2>
...
----
<1> A node within the {es} cluster {eh} will be connecting to. By default, {eh} will detect the rest of the nodes in the cluster.
<2> The `resource` (index/type) {eh} will use to read and write data.

Simply use the configuration object when constructing the Hadoop job and you are all set.

[float]
=== Writing data to {es}

With {eh}, {mr} jobs can write data to {es} making it searchable through {ref}/glossary.html#glossary-index[indexes]. {eh} supports both (so-called)  http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/api/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/package-use.html['old'] and http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/api/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/package-use.html['new'] Hadoop APIs.

`EsOutputFormat` expects a `Map<Writable, Writable>` representing a _document_ value that is converted internally into a JSON document and indexed in {es}.
Hadoop `OutputFormat` requires implementations to expect a key and a value however, since for {es} only the document (that is the value) is necessary, `EsOutputFormat`
ignores the key.

[float]
==== 'Old' (`org.apache.hadoop.mapred`) API

To write data to ES, use `org.elasticsearch.hadoop.mr.EsOutputFormat` on your job along with the relevant configuration <<configuration,properties>>:

[source,java]
----
JobConf conf = new JobConf();
conf.setSpeculativeExecution(false);           <1>
conf.set("es.nodes", "es-server:9200");
conf.set("es.resource", "radio/artists");      <2>
conf.setOutputFormat(EsOutputFormat.class);    <3>
conf.setMapOutputValueClass(MapWritable.class);<4>
conf.setMapperClass(MyMapper.class);
...
JobClient.runJob(conf);
----

<1> Disable speculative execution
<2> Target index/type
<3> Dedicated `OutputFormat`
<4> Specify the mapper output class (`MapWritable`)

A `Mapper` implementation can use `EsOutputFormat` as follows:
[source,java]
----
public class MyMapper extends MapReduceBase implements Mapper {
 @Override
 public void map(Object key, Object value, OutputCollector output,
                    Reporter reporter) throws IOException {
   // create the MapWritable object
   MapWritable doc = new MapWritable();
   ...
   // write the result to the output collector
   // one can pass whatever value to the key; EsOutputFormat ignores it
   output.collect(NullWritable.get(), map);
 }}
----

For cases where the id (or other metadata fields like +ttl+ or +timestamp+) of the document needs to be specified, one can do so by setting the appropriate <<cfg-mapping, mapping>> namely +es.mapping.id+. Thus assuming the documents contain a field called +radioId+ which is unique and is suitable for an identifier, one can update the job configuration as follows:

[source,java]
----
JobConf conf = new JobConf();
conf.set("es.mapping.id", "radioId");
----

At runtime, {eh} will extract the value from each document and use it accordingly during the bulk call.


[float]
[[writing-json-old-api]]
==== Writing existing JSON to {es}

For cases where the job input data is already in JSON, {eh} allows direct indexing _without_ applying any transformation; the data is taken as is and sent directly to {es}. In such cases, one needs to indicate the json input by setting
the `es.input.json` parameter. As such, in this case {eh} expects either a `Text` or `BytesWritable` (preferred as it requires no `String` conversion) object as output; if these types are not used, the library will simply fall back to the `toString` representation of the target object.

.`Writable` to use for JSON representation

[cols="^,^",options="header"]
|===
| `Writable` | Comment

| `BytesWritable`   | use this when the JSON data is represented as a `byte[]` or similar
| `Text`            | use this if the JSON data is represented as a `String`
| _anything else_   | make sure the `toString()` returns the desired JSON document

|===

IMPORTANT: Make sure the data is properly encoded, in `UTF-8`. The job output is considered the final form of the document sent to {es}.

[source,java]
----
JobConf conf = new JobConf();
conf.set("es.input.json", "yes");        <1>
conf.setMapOutputValueClass(Text.class); <2>
...
JobClient.runJob(conf);
----

<1> Indicate the input for `EsOutputFormat` is of type JSON.
<2> Set the proper output type (`Text` in this case)

The `Mapper` implementation becomes:
[source,java]
----
public class MyMapper extends MapReduceBase implements Mapper {
 @Override
 public void map(Object key, Object value, OutputCollector output,
                    Reporter reporter) throws IOException {
   // assuming the document is a String called 'source'
   String source =  ...
   Text jsonDoc = new Text(source);
   // send the doc directly
   output.collect(NullWritable.get(), jsonDoc);
 }}
----

[float]
[[writing-dyn-index-old-api]]
==== Writing to dynamic/multi-resources

For cases when the data being written to {es} needs to be indexed under different buckets (based on the data content) one can use the `es.resource.write` field which accepts pattern that are resolved from the document content, at runtime.
Following the aforementioned <<cfg-multi-writes,media example>>, one could configure it as follows:

[source,java]
----
JobConf conf = new JobConf();
conf.set("es.resource.write","my-collection-{media-type}/doc");
----

If `Writable` objects are used, for each `MapWritable` {eh} will extract the value under `media-type` key and use that as the {es} index suffix. If raw JSON is used, then {eh} will parse the document, extract the field `media-type` and use its value accordingly.

[float]
==== 'New' (`org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce`) API

Using the 'new' is strikingly similar - in fact, the exact same class (`org.elasticsearch.hadoop.mr.EsOutputFormat`) is used:

[source,java]
----
Configuration conf = new Configuration();
conf.setBoolean("mapred.map.tasks.speculative.execution", false);    <1>
conf.setBoolean("mapred.reduce.tasks.speculative.execution", false); <2>
conf.set("es.nodes", "es-server:9200");
conf.set("es.resource", "radio/artists");                            <3>
Job job = new Job(conf);
job.setOutputFormatClass(EsOutputFormat.class);
job.setMapOutputValueClass(MapWritable.class);                       <4>
...
job.waitForCompletion(true);
----

<1> Disable mapper speculative execution
<2> Disable reducer speculative execution
<3> Target index/type
<4> Specify `Mapper` value output type (in this case `MapWritable`)

Same goes for the `Mapper` instance :

[source,java]
----
public class SomeMapper extends Mapper {
 @Override
 protected void map(Object key, Object value, Context context)
        throws IOException, InterruptedException {
   // create the MapWritable object
   MapWritable doc = new MapWritable();
   ...
   context.write(NullWritable.get(), doc);
 }}
----

Specifying the id or other document <<cfg-mapping, metadata>> is just as easy:

[source,java]
----
Configuration conf = new Configuration();
conf.set("es.mapping.id", "radioId");
----

[float]
[[writing-json-new-api]]
==== Writing existing JSON to {es}

As before, when dealing with JSON directly, under the 'new' API the configuration looks as follows:

[source,java]
----
Configuration conf = new Configuration();
conf.set("es.input.json", "yes");                 <1>
Job job = new Job(conf);
job.setMapOutputValueClass(BytesWritable.class); <2>
...
job.waitForCompletion(true);
----

<1> Indicate the input for `EsOutputFormat` is of type JSON.
<2> Set the output type, in this example `BytesWritable`

[source,java]
----
public class SomeMapper extends Mapper {
 @Override
 protected void map(Object key, Object value, Context context)
        throws IOException, InterruptedException {
   // assuming the document is stored as bytes
   byte[] source =  ...
   BytesWritable jsonDoc = new BytesWritable(source);
   // send the doc directly
   context.write(NullWritable.get(), jsonDoc);
 }}
----

[float]
[[writing-dyn-index-new-api]]
==== Writing to dynamic/multi-resources

As expected, the difference between the `old` and `new` API are minimal (to be read non-existing) in this case as well:

[source,java]
----
Configuration conf = new Configuration();
conf.set("es.resource.write","my-collection-{media-type}/doc");
...
----


[float]
[[mr-reading]]
=== Reading data from {es}

In a similar fashion, to read data from {es}, one needs to use `org.elasticsearch.hadoop.mr.EsInputFormat` class.
While it can read an entire index, it is much more convenient to use a query - {eh} will automatically execute the query __in real time__ and return back the feed the results back to Hadoop. Since the query is executed against the real data, this acts as a _live_ view of the data set.

Just like its counter partner (`EsOutputFormat`), `EsInputFormat` returns a `Map<Writable, Writable>` for each JSON document returned by {es}. Since the `InputFormat` requires both a key and a value to be returned, `EsInputFormat` will return the document id (inside {es}) as the key (typically ignored) and the document/map as the value.

TIP: If one needs the document structure returned from {es} to be preserved, consider using `org.elasticsearch.hadoop.mr.LinkedMapWritable`. The class extends Hadoop's `MapWritable` (and thus can easily replace it) and preserve insertion order; that is when iterating the map, the entries will be returned in insertion order (as oppose to `MapWritable` which does _not_ maintain it). However, due to the way Hadoop works, one needs to specify `LinkedMapWritable` as the job map output value (instead of `MapWritable`).


[float]
==== 'Old' (`org.apache.hadoop.mapred`) API

Following our example above on radio artists, to get a hold of all the artists that start with 'me', one could use the following snippet:

[source,java]
----
JobConf conf = new JobConf();
conf.set("es.resource", "radio/artists");       <1>
conf.set("es.query", "?q=me*");                 <2>
conf.setInputFormat(EsInputFormat.class);       <3>
conf.setMapOutputKeyClass(Text.class);          <4>
conf.setMapOutputValueClass(MapWritable.class); <5>

...
JobClient.runJob(conf);
----

<1> Target index/type
<2> Query
<3> Dedicated `InputFormat`
<4> `Text` as the key class (containing the document id)
<5> `MapWritable` or {eh}'s `LinkedMapWritable` (to preserve insertion order) as the value class (containing the document structure)

A `Mapper` using `EsInputFormat` might look as follows:

[source,java]
----
public class MyMapper extends MapReduceBase implements Mapper {
 @Override
 public void map(Object key, Object value, OutputCollector output,
                    Reporter reporter) throws IOException {
   Text docId = (Text) key;
   MapWritable doc = (MapWritable) value;      <1>
   ...
 }}
----
<1> `LinkedMapWritable` is type compatible with `MapWritable` so the cast will work for both

NOTE: Feel free to use Java 5 generics to avoid the cast above. For clarity and readability, the examples in this chapter
do not include generics.

[float]
==== 'New' (`org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce`) API

As expected, the `mapreduce` API version is quite similar:
[source,java]
----
Configuration conf = new Configuration();
conf.set("es.resource", "radio/artists/");            <1>
conf.set("es.query", "?q=me*");                       <2>
Job job = new Job(conf);
job.setInputFormatClass(EsInputFormat.class);
job.setMapOutputKeyClass(Text.class);
job.setMapOutputValueClass(MapWritable.class);        <3>
...

job.waitForCompletion(true);
----

<1> Target index/type
<2> Query
<3> `MapWritable` or {eh}'s `LinkedMapWritable` (to preserve insertion order) as the value class (containing the document structure)


and well as the `Mapper` implementation:

[source,java]
----
public class SomeMapper extends Mapper {
 @Override
 protected void map(Object key, Object value, Context context)
        throws IOException, InterruptedException {
   Text docId = (Text) key;
   MapWritable doc = (MapWritable) value;             <1>
   ...
 }}
----
<1> `LinkedMapWritable` is type compatible with `MapWritable` so the cast will work for both

[float]
[[mr-reading-as-json]]
==== Reading from {es} in JSON format

In the case where the results from {es} need to be in JSON format (typically to be sent down the wire to some other system), one can instruct {eh} to return the data as is. By setting `es.output.json` to `true`, the connector will parse the response from {es}, identify the documents and, without converting them, return their content to the user as +Text+ objects:

[source,java]
----
Configuration conf = new Configuration();
conf.set("es.resource", "source/category");
conf.set("es.output.json", "true");
----

[float]
[[mr-read-write-job]]
==== Using different indices for reading and writing

Sometimes, one needs to read data from one {es} resource, process it and then write it back to a different resource inside the 'same' job . `es.resource` setting is not enough since it implies the same resource both as a source and destination.
In such cases, one should use `es.resource.read` and `es.resource.write` to differentiate between the two resources (the example below uses the 'mapreduce' API):

[source,java]
----
Configuration conf = new Configuration();
conf.set("es.resource.read", "source/category");
conf.set("es.resource.write", "sink/group");
----

[[type-conversion-writable]]
[float]
=== Type conversion

IMPORTANT: If automatic index creation is used, please review <<auto-mapping-type-loss,this>> section for more information.

{eh} automatically converts Hadoop built-in `Writable` types to {es} {ref}/mapping-types.html[field types] (and back) as shown in the table below:

.`Writable` Conversion Table

[cols="^,^",options="header"]
|===
| `Writable` | {es} type

| `null`            | `null`
| `NullWritable`    | `null`
| `BooleanWritable` | `boolean`
| `Text`            | `string`
| `ByteWritable`    | `byte`
| `IntWritable`     | `int`
| `VInt`            | `int`
| `LongWritable`    | `long`
| `VLongWritable`   | `long`
| `BytesWritable`   | `binary`
| `DoubleWritable`  | `double`
| `FloatWritable`   | `float`
| `MD5Writable`     | `string`
| `ArrayWritable`   | `array`
| `AbstractMapWritable` | `map`
| `ShortWritable`   | `short`

|===

It is worth mentioning that rich data types available only in {es}, such as https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.1/geo-point.html[+GeoPoint+] or https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.1/geo-shape.html[+GeoShape+] are supported by converting their structure into the primitives available in the table above. For example, based on its storage a +geo_point+ might be
returned as a +Text+ (basically a +String+) or an +ArrayWritable+.
