== Hadoop Metrics

The Hadoop system records a set of metric counters for each job that it runs. {eh} extends on that and provides metrics about its activity for each job run by leveraging the Hadoop http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r{hadoop-docs-v}/api/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/Counters.html[Counters] infrastructure. During each run, {eh} sends statistics from each task instance, as it is running, which get aggregated by the {mr} infrastructure and are available through the standard Hadoop APIs.

{eh} provides the following counters, available under `org.elasticsearch.hadoop.mr.Counter` enum:

.Available counters
[cols="^,^",options="header"]

|===
| Counter name | Purpose

2+h| Data focused

| BYTES_SENT     | Total number of data/communication bytes sent over the network to {es}
| BYTES_ACCEPTED | Data/Documents accepted by {es} in bytes 
| BYTES_RETRIED  | Data/Documents rejected by {es} in bytes 
| BYTES_RECEIVED | Data/Documents received from {es} in bytes 

2+h| Document focused

| DOCS_SENT     | Number of docs sent over the network to {es}
| DOCS_ACCEPTED | Number of documents sent and accepted by {es} 
| DOCS_RETRIED  | Number of documents sent but rejected by {es} 
| DOCS_RECEIVED | Number of documents received from {es} 

2+h| Network focused

| BULK_TOTAL   | Number of bulk requests made to {es}
| BULK_RETRIES | Number of bulk retries (caused by document rejections) 
| SCROLL_TOTAL | Number of scroll pulled from {es}
| NODE_RETRIES | Number of node fall backs (caused by network errors) 
| NET_RETRIES  | Number of network retries (caused by network errors) 

2+h| Time focused

| NET_TOTAL_TIME_MS 		 | Overall time (in ms) spent over the network 
| BULK_TOTAL_TIME_MS 		 | Time (in ms) spent over the network by the bulk requests 
| BULK_RETRIES_TOTAL_TIME_MS | Time (in ms) spent over the network retrying bulk requests 
| SCROLL_TOTAL_TIME_MS       | Time (in ms) spent over the network reading the scroll requests 

|===

One can use the counters programatically, depending on the API used, through http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r{hadoop-docs-v}/api/index.html?org/apache/hadoop/mapred/Counters.html[mapred] or http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r{hadoop-docs-v}/api/index.html?org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/Counter.html[mapreduce]. Whatever the choice, {eh} performs automatic reports without any user intervention. In fact, when using {eh} one will see the stats reported at the end of the job run, for example:
