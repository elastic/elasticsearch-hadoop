== Apache Hive integration

[quote, Hive website]
____
http://hive.apache.org/[Hive] is a data warehouse system for Hadoop that facilitates easy data summarization, ad-hoc queries, and the analysis of large datasets stored in Hadoop compatible file systems. 
____

Hive abstracts Hadoop by abstracting it through SQL-like language, called HiveQL so that users can apply data defining and manipulating operations to it, just like with SQL. In Hive data sets are https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted#GettingStarted-DDLOperations[defined] through 'tables' (that expose type information) in which data can be https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted#GettingStarted-DMLOperations[loaded], https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted#GettingStarted-SQLOperations[selected and transformed] through built-in operators or custom/user defined functions (or https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/OperatorsAndFunctions[UDF]s).

=== Installation

Make {eh} jar available in the Hive classpath. Depending on your options, there are various https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HivePlugins#HivePlugins-DeployingjarsforUserDefinedFunctionsandUserDefinedSerDes[ways] to achieve that. Use https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Cli#LanguageManualCli-HiveResources[ADD] command to add files, jars (what we want) or archives to the classpath:

----
ADD JAR /path/elasticsearch-hadoop.jar;
----

NOTE: the command expects a proper URI that can be found either on the local file-system or remotely. Typically it's best to use a distributed file-system (like HDFS or Amazon S3) and use that since the script might be executed
on various machines.

IMPORTANT: When using JDBC/ODBC drivers, ++ADD JAR++ command is not available and will be ignored. Thus it is recommend to make the jar available to the Hive global classpath and indicated below.

As an alternative, one can use the command-line:

.CLI configuration
[source,bash]
----
$ bin/hive --auxpath=/path/elasticsearch-hadoop.jar
----
or use the `hive.aux.jars.path` property specified either through the command-line or, if available, through the `hive-site.xml` file, to register additional jars (that accepts an URI as well):

[source,bash]
----
$ bin/hive -hiveconf hive.aux.jars.path=/path/elasticsearch-hadoop.jar
----
or if the `hive-site.xml` configuration can be modified, one can register additional jars through the `hive.aux.jars.path` option (that accepts an URI as well):

.`hive-site.xml` configuration
[source,xml]
----
<property>
  <name>hive.aux.jars.path</name>
  <value>/path/elasticsearch-hadoop.jar</value>
  <description>A comma separated list (with no spaces) of the jar files</description>
</property>
----


[[hive-configuration]]
[float]
=== Configuration

When using Hive, one can use `TBLPROPERTIES` to specify the <<configuration,configuration>> properties (as an alternative to Hadoop `Configuration` object) when declaring the external table backed by {es}:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE artists (...)
STORED BY 'org.elasticsearch.hadoop.hive.EsStorageHandler'
TBLPROPERTIES('es.resource' = 'radio/artists',
              'es.index.auto.create' = 'false'); <1>
----

<1> {eh} setting

[[hive-alias]]
[float]
=== Mapping

By default, {eh} uses the Hive table schema to map the data in {es}, using both the field names and types in the process. There are cases however when the names in Hive cannot
be used with {es} (the field name can contain characters accepted by {es} but not by Hive). For such cases, one can use the `es.mapping.names` setting which accepts a comma-separated list of mapped names in the following format: `Hive field name`:`Elasticsearch field name`

To wit:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE artists (...)
STORED BY 'org.elasticsearch.hadoop.hive.EsStorageHandler'
TBLPROPERTIES('es.resource' = 'radio/artists',
            'es.mapping.names' = 'date:@timestamp, url:url_123'); <1>
----

<1> Hive column `date` mapped in {es} to `@timestamp`; Hive column `url` mapped in {es} to `url_123`

TIP: Hive is case **insensitive** while {es} is not. The loss of information can create invalid queries (as the column in Hive might not match the one in {es}). To avoid this, {eh} will always convert Hive column names to lower-case. 
This being said, it is recommended to use the default Hive style and use upper-case names only for Hive commands and avoid mixed-case names.

TIP: Hive treats missing values through a special value `NULL` as indicated https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Types#LanguageManualTypes-HandlingofNULLValues[here]. This means that when running an incorrect query (with incorrect or non-existing field names) the Hive tables will be populated with `NULL` instead of throwing an exception. Make sure to validate your data and keep a close eye on your schema since updates will otherwise go unnotice due to this lenient behavior.

[float]
=== Writing data to {es}

With {eh}, {es} becomes just an external https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual`DDL#LanguageManualDDL-CreateTable[table] in which data can be loaded or read from:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE artists (
    id      BIGINT,
    name    STRING,
    links   STRUCT<url:STRING, picture:STRING>)
STORED BY 'org.elasticsearch.hadoop.hive.EsStorageHandler'<1>
TBLPROPERTIES('es.resource' = 'radio/artists'); <2>

-- insert data to Elasticsearch from another table called 'source'
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE artists 
    SELECT NULL, s.name, named_struct('url', s.url, 'picture', s.picture)
                    FROM source s;
----

<1> {es} Hive `StorageHandler`
<2> {es} resource (index and type) associated with the given storage

For cases where the id (or other metadata fields like +ttl+ or +timestamp+) of the document needs to be specified, one can do so by setting the appropriate <<cfg-mapping, mapping>>, namely +es.mapping.id+. Following the previous example, to indicate to {es} to use the field +id+ as the document id, update the +table+ properties:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE artists (
    id      BIGINT,
    ...)
STORED BY 'org.elasticsearch.hadoop.hive.EsStorageHandler'
TBLPROPERTIES('es.mapping.id' = 'id'...);
----

[[writing-json-hive]]
==== Writing existing JSON to {es}

For cases where the job input data is already in JSON, {eh} allows direct indexing _without_ applying any transformation; the data is taken as is and sent directly to {es}. In such cases, one needs to indicate the json input by setting
the `es.input.json` parameter. As such, in this case {eh} expects the output table to contain only one field, who's content is used as the JSON document. That is, the library will recognize specific 'textual' types (such as `string` or `binary`) or simply call (`toString`).

.Hive types to use for JSON representation

[cols="^,^",options="header"]
|===
| `Hive type` | Comment 

| `binary`          | use this when the JSON data is represented as a `byte[]` or similar
| `string`          | use this if the JSON data is represented as a `String`
| _anything else_   | make sure the `toString()` returns the desired JSON document
| `varchar`         | use this as an alternative to Hive `string`

|===

IMPORTANT: Make sure the data is properly encoded, in `UTF-8`. The field content is considered the final form of the document sent to {es}.

[source,java]
----
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE json (data STRING) <1>
STORED BY 'org.elasticsearch.hadoop.hive.EsStorageHandler'
TBLPROPERTIES('es.resource' = '...',
              'es.input.json` = 'yes'); <2>
...
----

<1> The table declaration only one field of type `STRING`
<2> Indicate {eh} the table content is in JSON format

[float]
==== Writing to dynamic/multi-resources

One can index the data to a different resource, depending on the 'row' being read, by using patterns. Coming back to the aforementioned <<cfg-multi-writes,media example>>, one could configure it as follows:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE media (
    name    STRING,
    type    STRING,<1>
    year    STRING,
STORED BY 'org.elasticsearch.hadoop.hive.EsStorageHandler'
TBLPROPERTIES('es.resource' = 'my-collection-{type}/doc'); <2>
----

<1> Table field used by the resource pattern. Any of the declared fields can be used.
<2> Resource pattern using field `type`


For each 'row' about to be written, {eh} will extract the `type` field and use its value to determine the target resource.

The functionality is also available when dealing with raw JSON - in this case, the value will be extracted from the JSON document itself. Assuming the JSON source contains documents with the following structure:

[source,js]
----
{
    "media_type":"music",<1>
    "title":"Surfing With The Alien",
    "year":"1987"
}
----
<1> field within the JSON document that will be used by the pattern

the table declaration can be as follows:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE json (data STRING) <1>
STORED BY 'org.elasticsearch.hadoop.hive.EsStorageHandler'
TBLPROPERTIES('es.resource' = 'my-collection-{media_type}/doc', <2>
              'es.input.json` = 'yes');
----

<1> Schema declaration for the table. Since JSON input is used, the schema is simply a holder to the raw data
<2> Resource pattern relying on fields _within_ the JSON document and _not_ on the table schema

[float]
=== Reading data from {es}

Reading from {es} is strikingly similar:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE artists (
    id      BIGINT,
    name    STRING,
    links   STRUCT<url:STRING, picture:STRING>)
STORED BY 'org.elasticsearch.hadoop.hive.EsStorageHandler'<1>
TBLPROPERTIES('es.resource' = 'radio/artists', <2>
              'es.query' = '?q=me*');          <3>

-- stream data from Elasticsearch
SELECT * FROM artists;
----

<1> same {es} Hive `StorageHandler`
<2> {es} resource
<3> {es} query

=== Type conversion

IMPORTANT: If automatic index creation is used, please review <<auto-mapping-type-loss,this>> section for more information.

Hive provides various https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual`Types[types] for defining data and internally uses different implementations depending on the target environment (from JDK native types to binary-optimized ones). {es} integrates with all of them, including
and Serde2 http://hive.apache.org/javadocs/r1.0.1/api/index.html?org/apache/hadoop/hive/serde2/lazy/package-summary.html[lazy] and http://hive.apache.org/javadocs/r1.0.1/api/index.html?org/apache/hadoop/hive/serde2/lazybinary/package-summary.html[lazy binary]:

[cols="^,^",options="header"]

|===
| Hive type | {es} type

| `void`            | `null`
| `boolean`         | `boolean`
| `tinyint`         | `byte`
| `smallint`        | `short`
| `int`             | `int`
| `bigint`          | `long`
| `double`          | `double`
| `float`           | `float`
| `string`          | `string`
| `binary`          | `binary`
| `timestamp`       | `date`
| `struct`          | `map`
| `map`             | `map`
| `array`           | `array`
| `union`           | not supported (yet)
| `decimal`         | `string`
| `date`            | `date`
| `varchar`         | `string`
| `char`            | `string`

|===

NOTE: While {es} understands Hive types up to version 2.0, it is backwards compatible with Hive 1.0

It is worth mentioning that rich data types available only in {es}, such as https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.1/geo-point.html[+GeoPoint+] or https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.1/geo-shape.html[+GeoShape+] are supported by converting their structure into the primitives available in the table above. For example, based on its storage a +geo_point+ might be
returned as a +string+ or an +array+.
