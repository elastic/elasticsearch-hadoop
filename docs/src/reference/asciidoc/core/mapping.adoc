== Mapping and Types

As explained in the previous sections, {eh} integrates closely with the Hadoop ecosystem and perform close introspection of the type information so that the data flow between {es} and Hadoop is as transparent as possible.
This section takes a closer look at how the type conversion takes place and how data is mapped between the two systems.

[float]
=== Converting data to {es}

By design, {eh} provides no data transformation or mapping layer itself simply because there is no need for them: Hadoop is designed to do ETL and some libraries (like Pig and Hive) provide type information themselves; further more {es} has rich support for mapping out of the box including automatic detection,  dynamic/schema-less mapping, templates and full manual control.
Need to split strings into token, do data validation or eliminate unneeded data ? There are plenty of ways to do that in Hadoop before reading/writing data from/to {es}; need control over how data is stored in {es} ? Use {es} APIs to define the  {ref}/indices-put-mapping.html[mapping], to update {ref}/indices-update-settings.html[settings] or add generic {ref}/mapping-fields.html[meta-data].

Instead of 'reinventing the wheel' and replicating functionality, {eh} focuses on what is missing by recognizing and leveraging existing features.

[[mapping-date]]
=== Time/Date mapping

When it comes to handling dates, {es} always uses the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO 8601] format for date/time. This is the default date format of {es} - if a custom one is needed, please *add* it to the default option rather then just replacing it. See the {ref}/mapping-date-format.html[date format] section in {es} reference documentation for more information.
Note that when reading data, if the date is not in ISO8601 format, by default {eh} will likely not understand it as it does not replicate the elaborate date parsing in {es}. In these cases one can simply disable the date conversion
and pass the raw information as a `long` or `String`, through the `es.mapping.rich.date` <<cfg-field-info, property>>.

As a side note, {eh} tries to detect whether dedicated date parsing libraries (in particular Joda, used also by {es}) are available at runtime and if so, will use them. If not, it will default to parsing using JDK classes which are not
as rich. Going forward especially with the advent of JDK 8, {eh} will try to migrate to `javax.time` library to have the same behaviour regardless of the classpath available at runtime.

[float]
[[mapping-arrays]]
=== Ordering and Mapping

It is important to note that JSON objects (delimited by `{}` and typically associated with maps) are *unordered*, in other words, they do *not* maintain order. JSON
arrays (typically associated with lists or sequences) are *ordered*, that is, they *do* preserve the initial insertion order. This impacts the way objects are read from {es} as one might find the insertion structure to be different than the extraction one.
It is however easy to circumvent this problem - as JSON objects (maps) contain fields, use the field names (or keys) instead of their position inside the document to reliably get their values (in Java terms think of a JSON object as a +HashMap+ as oppose to a +LinkedHashMap+).

[float]
[[mapping-geo]]
=== Geo types

For geolocation {es} provides two dedicated types, namely https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.1/geo-point.html[+geo_point+] and https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.1/geo-shape.html[+geo_shape+]
which do not have a direct equivalent in any of the libraries {eh} integrates with. Further more, {es} accepts multiple formats for each type (as there are different ways to represent data), in fact there are 4 different representations
for +geo_point+ and 9 for +geo_shape+.
To go around this, the connector breaks down the geo types into primitives depending on the actual format used for their respective types. 

For strongly-typed libraries (like SparkSQL ++DataFrame++s), the format needs to be known before hand and thus, {eh} will _sample_ the data asking {eh} for one random document that is representative of the mapping, parse it and based
on the values found, identify the format used and create the necessary schema. This happens automatically at start-up without any user interference. As always, the user data must all be using the _same_ format (a requirement from
SparkSQL) otherwise reading a different format will trigger an exception.

Note that typically handling of these types poses no issues for the user whether reading or writing data.

[float]
[[mapping-multi-values]]
=== Handling array/multi-values fields

{es} treats fields with single or multi-values the same; in fact the mapping provides no information about this. As a client though, it means one cannot tell whether a field is single-valued or not until is actually being read. In most cases this is not an issue and {eh} automatically creates the necessary list/array on the fly. However in environments with strict schema such as Spark SQL, changing a field actual value from its declared type is not allowed worse yet, this information needs to be available even before reading the data. And since the mapping is not conclusive enough, {eh} allows the user to specify the extra information through <<cfg-field-info, field information>> specifically +es.field.read.as.array.include+ and +es.field.read.as.array.include+.

[float]
=== Automatic mapping

By default, {es} provides {ref}/docs-index_.html[automatic index and mapping] when data is added under an index that has not been created before. In other words, data can be added into {es} without the index and the mappings being defined a priori. This is quite convenient since {es} automatically adapts to the data being fed to it - moreover, if certain entries have extra fields, {es} schema-less nature allows them to be indexed without any issues.

[[auto-mapping-type-loss]]
It is important to remember that automatic mapping uses the payload values to identify its {ref}/mapping.html#mapping-type[type], using the *first document* creates the mapping. {eh} communicates with {es} through JSON which does not provide any type information, rather only the field names and their values. One can think of it as 'type erasure' or information loss; for example JSON does not differentiate integer numeric types - `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long` are all placed in the same `long` 'bucket'. this can have unexpected side-effects since the type information is _guessed_ such as:

[float]
===== numbers mapped only as `long`/`double`
Whenever {es} encounters a number, it will allocate the largest type for it since it does not know the exact number type of the field. Allocating a small type (such as `byte`, `int` or `float`) can lead to problems if a future document is larger, so {es} uses a safe default.
For example, the document:
[source, json]
----
{
    "tweet" {
        "user" : "kimchy",
        "message" : "This is a tweet!",
        "postDate" : "2009-11-15T14:12:12",
        "priority" : 4,
        "rank" : 12.3
    }
}
----
triggers the following mapping:
[source, json]
----
{ "test" : {
    "mappings" : {
      "index" : {
        "properties" : {
          "message" : {
            "type" : "string"
          },
          "postDate" : {
            "type" : "date",
            "format" : "dateOptionalTime"      <1>
          },
          "priority" : {
            "type" : "long"                    <2>
          },
          "rank" : {
            "type" : "double"                  <3>
          },
          "user" : {
            "type" : "string"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----
<1> The _postDate_ field was recognized as a date in ISO 8601 format (+dateOptionalTime+)
<2> The _integer_ number (+4+) was mapped to the largest available type (+long+)
<3> The _fractional_ number (+12.3+) was mapped to the largest available type (+double+)

[float]
===== incorrect mapping
This happens when a string field contains numbers (say +1234+) - {es} has no information that the number is actually a string and thus it map the field as a number, causing a parsing exception when a string is encountered.
For example, this document:
[source, json]
----
{ "array":[123, "string"] }
----

causes an exception with automatic mapping:
[source, json]
----
{"error":"MapperParsingException[failed to parse [array]]; nested: NumberFormatException[For input string: \"string\"]; ","status":400}
----

because the field +array+ is initially detected as a number (because of +123+) which causes +"string"+ to trigger the parsing exception since clearly it is not a number. The same issue tends to occur with strings might be
interpreted as dates.

Hence if the defaults need to be overridden and/or if you experience the problems exposed above, potentially due to a diverse dataset, consider using <<explicit-mapping>>.

[float]
==== Disabling automatic mapping

{es} allows 'automatic index creation' as well as 'dynamic mapping' (for extra fields present in documents) to be disabled through the `action.auto_create_index` and `index.mapper.dynamic` settings on the nodes config files. As a safety net, {eh} provides a dedicated configuration <<configuration-options-index,option>> `es.index.auto.create` which allows {eh} to either create the index or not without having to modify the {es} cluster options.

[float]
[[explicit-mapping]]
=== Explicit mapping

Explicit or manual mapping should be considered when the defaults need to be overridden, if the data is detected incorrectly (as explained above) or, in most cases, to customize the index analysis.
Refer to {es} {ref}/indices-create-index.html[create index] and {ref}/indices-put-mapping.html[mapping] documentation on how to define an index and its types - note that these need to be present *before* data is being uploaded to {es} (otherwise automatic mapping will be used by {es}, if enabled).

TIP: In most cases, {ref}/indices-templates.html[templates] are quite handy as they are automatically applied to new indices created that match the pattern; in other words instead of defining the mapping per index, one can just define the template once and then have it applied to all indices that match its pattern.
