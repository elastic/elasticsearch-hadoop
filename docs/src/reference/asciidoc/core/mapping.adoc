== Mapping and Types

As explained in the previous sections, {eh} integrates closely with the Hadoop ecosystem and perform close introspection of the type information so that the data flow between {es} and Hadoop is as transparent as possible.
This section takes a closer look at how the type conversion takes place and how data is mapped between the two systems.

[float]
=== Converting data to {es}

By design, {eh} provides no data transformation or mapping layer itself simply because there is no need for them: Hadoop is designed to do ETL and some libraries (like Pig and Hive) provide type information themselves; further more {es} has rich support for mapping out of the box including automatic detection,  dynamic/schema-less mapping, templates and full manual control. 
Need to split strings into token, do data validation or eliminate unneeded data ? There are plenty of ways to do that in Hadoop before reading/writing data from/to {es}; need control over how data is stored in {es} ? Use {es} APIs to define the  {ref}/indices-put-mapping.html[mapping], to update {ref}/indices-update-settings.html[settings] or add generic {ref}/mapping-fields.html[meta-data].

Instead of 'reinventing the wheel' and replicating functionality, {eh} focuses on what is missing by recognizing and leveraging existing features.

[[mapping-date]]
=== Time/Date mapping

When it comes to handling dates, {es} always uses the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO 8601] format for date/time. This is the default date format of {es} - if a custom one is needed, please *add* it to the default option rather then just replacing it. See the {ref}/mapping-date-format.html[date format] section in {eh} reference documentation for more information.

[float]
=== Automatic mapping

By default, {es} provides {ref}/docs-index_.html[automatic index and mapping] when data is added under an index that has not been created before. In other words, data can be added into {es} without the index and the mappings being defined a priori. This is quite convenient since {es} automatically adapts to the data being fed to it - moreover, if certain entries have extra fields, {es} schema-less nature allows them to be indexed without any issues.

[[auto-mapping-type-loss]]
It is important to remember that automatic mapping uses the payload values to identify its {ref}/mapping.html#mapping-type[type], using the *first document* creates the mapping. {eh} communicates with {es} through JSON which does not provide any type information, rather only the field names and their values. One can think of it as 'type erasure' or information loss; for example JSON does not differentiate integer numeric types - `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long` are all placed in the same `long` 'bucket'. this can have unexpected side-effects since the type information is _guessed_ such as:

[float]
===== numbers mapped only as `long`/`double`
Whenever {es} encounters a number, it will allocate the largest type for it since it does not know the exact number type of the field. Allocating a small type (such as `byte`, `int` or `float`) can lead to problems if a future document is larger, so {es} uses a safe default. 
For example, the document:
[source, json]
----
{
    "tweet" {
        "user" : "kimchy",
        "message" : "This is a tweet!",
        "postDate" : "2009-11-15T14:12:12",
        "priority" : 4,
        "rank" : 12.3
    }
}
----
triggers the following mapping:
[source, json]
----
{ "test" : {
    "mappings" : {
      "index" : {
        "properties" : {
          "message" : {
            "type" : "string"
          },
          "postDate" : {                       
            "type" : "date",
            "format" : "dateOptionalTime"      <1> 
          },
          "priority" : {
            "type" : "long"                    <2>
          },
          "rank" : {
            "type" : "double"                  <3>
          },
          "user" : {
            "type" : "string"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----
<1> The _postDate_ field was recognized as a date in ISO 8601 format (+dateOptionalTime+)
<2> The _integer_ number (+4+) was mapped to the largest available type (+long+)
<3> The _fractional_ number (+12.3+) was mapped to the largest available type (+double+)

[float]
===== incorrect mapping
This happens when a string field contains numbers (say +1234+) - {es} has no information that the number is actually a string and thus it map the field as a number, causing a parsing exception when a string is encountered.
For example, this document:
[source, json]
----
{ "array":[123, "string"] }
----

causes an exception with automatic mapping:
[source, json]
----
{"error":"MapperParsingException[failed to parse [array]]; nested: NumberFormatException[For input string: \"string\"]; ","status":400}
----

because the field +array+ is initially detected as a number (because of +123+) which causes +"string"+ to trigger the parsing exception since clearly it is not a number. The same issue tends to occur with strings might be 
interpreted as dates.

Hence if the defaults need to be overridden and/or if you experience the problems exposed above, potentially due to a diverse dataset, consider using <<explicit-mapping>>.

[float]
==== Disabling automatic mapping

{es} allows 'automatic index creation' as well as 'dynamic mapping' (for extra fields present in documents) to be disabled through the `action.auto_create_index` and `index.mapper.dynamic` settings on the nodes config files. As a safety net, {eh} provides a dedicated configuration <<configuration-options-index,option>> `es.index.auto.create` which allows {eh} to either create the index or not without having to modify the {es} cluster options.

[float]
[[explicit-mapping]]
=== Explicit mapping

Explicit or manual mapping should be considered when the defaults need to be overridden, if the data is detected incorrectly (as explained above) or, in most cases, to customize the index analysis.
Refer to {es} {ref}/indices-create-index.html[create index] and {ref}/indices-put-mapping.html[mapping] documentation on how to define an index and its types - note that these need to be present *before* data is being uploaded to {es} (otherwise automatic mapping will be used by {es}, if enabled).

TIP: In most cases, {ref}/indices-templates.html[templates] are quite handy as they are automatically applied to new indices created that match the pattern; in other words instead of defining the mapping per index, one can just define the template once and then have it applied to all indices that match its pattern.
