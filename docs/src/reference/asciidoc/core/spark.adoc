== Apache Spark support

[quote, Spark website]
____
http://spark.apache.org[Apache Spark] is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala and Python, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs.
____
Spark provides fast iterative/functional-like capabilities over large data sets, typically by _caching_ data in memory. As opposed to the rest of the libraries mentioned in this documentation, Apache Spark is computing framework that is not tied to {mr} itself however it does integrate with Hadoop, mainly to HDFS.
{eh} allows {es} to be used in Spark in two ways: through the dedicated support available since 2.1 or through the {mr} bridge since 2.0

[[spark-installation]]
[float]
=== Installation

Just like other libraries, {eh} needs to be available in Spark's classpath. As Spark has multiple deployment modes, this can translate to the target classpath, whether it is on only one node (as is the case with the local mode - which will be used through-out the documentation) or per-node depending on the desired infrastructure.

[[spark-native]]
[float]
=== Native support

added[2.1]

{eh} provides _native_ integration between {es} and {sp}, in the form of a RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) that can read data from Elasticsearch. The RDD is offered in two 'flavors': one for Scala (which returns the data as Scala collections) and one for Java (which returns the data though `java.util` collections).

IMPORTANT: Whenever possible, consider using the _native_ integration as it offers the best performance and maximum flexibility.

[[spark-native-cfg]]
[float]
==== Configuration

To configure one, one can set the various properties described in the <<configuration>> chapter through the http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.0.1/programming-guide.html#initializing-spark[`SparkConf`] object:

[source,scala]
----
import org.apache.spark.SparkConf

val conf = new SparkConf().setAppName(appName).setMaster(master)
conf.set("es.index.auto.create", "true")
----

[source,java]
----
SparkConf conf = new SparkConf().setAppName(appName).setMaster(master);
conf.set("es.index.auto.create", "true");
----

[float]
[[spark-write]]
==== Writing data to {es}

With {eh}, any +RDD+ can be saved to {es} as long as its content can be translated into documents. When that is not the case, one can easily _transform_ the data
in Spark or plug-in their own customer <<configuration-serialization,+ValueWriter+>>.

.Scala

When using Scala, simply import the `org.elasticsearch.spark` package which, through the http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=179766[__pimp my library__] pattern, enriches the  _any_ +RDD+ API with `saveToEs` methods:

[source,scala]
----
import org.apache.spark.SparkContext    <1>
import org.apache.spark.SparkContext._

import org.elasticsearch.spark._        <2>

...

val conf = ...
val sc = new SparkContext(conf)         <3>

val numbers = Map("one" -> 1, "two" -> 2, "three" -> 3)
val airports = Map("OTP" -> "Otopeni", "SFO" -> "San Fran")

sc.makeRDD<4>(Seq(numbers, airports)).saveToEs<5>("spark/docs")
----

<1> Spark Scala imports
<2> {eh} Scala imports
<3> start Spark through its Scala API
<4> `makeRDD` creates an ad-hoc `RDD` based on the collection specified; any other RDD (in Java or Scala) can be passed in
<5> index the content (namely the two _documents_ (numbers and airports)) in {es} under `spark/docs`

NOTE: Scala users might be tempted to use +Seq+ and the +->+ notation for declaring _root_ objects (that is the JSON document) instead of using a +Map+. While similar, the first notation results in slightly different types that cannot be matched to a JSON document: +Seq+ is an order sequence (in other words a list) while +<-+ creates a +Tuple+ which is more or less an ordered, fixed number of elements. As such, a list of lists cannot be used as a document since it cannot be mapped to a JSON object; however it can be used freely within one. Hence why in the example above ++Map(k->v)++ was used instead of ++Seq(k->v)++

.Java

Java users have a dedicated class that provides a similar functionality, namely +org.elasticsearch.hadoop.spark.api.java.JavaEsSpark+,similar to Spark's https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.0.1/api/java/index.html?org/apache/spark/api/java/package-summary.html[Java API]:

[source,java]
----
import org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaSparkContext;   <1>
import org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaRDD;
import org.apache.spark.SparkConf;

import org.elasticsearch.spark.java.api.JavaEsSpark; <2>
...

SparkConf conf = ...
JavaSparkContext jsc = new JavaSparkContext(conf);   <3>

Map<String, ?> numbers = ImmutableMap.of("one", 1, "two", 2);     <4>
Map<String, ?> airports = ImmutableMap.of("OTP", "Otopeni", "SFO", "San Fran");

JavaRDD<Map<String, ?>> javaRDD = jsc.parallelize(ImmutableList.of(doc1, doc2)); <5>
JavaEsSpark.saveToEs(javaRDD, "spark/docs"); <6>
----

<1> Spark Java imports
<2> {eh} Java imports
<3> start Spark through its Java API
<4> to simplify the example, use https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/[Guava](a dependency of Spark) +Immutable+* methods for simple +Map+, +List+ creation
<5> create a simple +RDD+ over the two collections; any other RDD (in Java or Scala) can be passed in
<6> index the content (namely the two _documents_ (numbers and airports)) in {es} under `spark/docs`

The code can be further simplifies by using Java 5 _static_ imports, namely:

[source,java]
----
import static org.elasticsearch.spark.java.api.JavaEsSpark; <1>
...
saveToEs(javaRDD, "spark/docs"); <2>
----

<1> statically import +JavaEsSpark+
<2> call +saveToEs+ method without having to type +JavaEsSpark+ again

[float]
[[spark-write-json]]
==== Writing existing JSON to {es}

For cases where the data in the `RDD` is already in JSON, {eh} allows direct indexing _without_ applying any transformation; the data is taken as is and sent directly to {es}. As such, in this case, {eh} expects either an +RDD+
containing +String+ or byte arrays (+byte[]+/+Array[Byte]+), assuming each entry represents a JSON document. If the +RDD+ does not have the proper signature, the +saveJsonToEs+ methods cannot be applied (in Scala they will not be available).
This method is implemented using Elasticsearch's http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-bulk.html[Bulk API] so entries must not contain newline characters.

.Scala

[source,scala]
----
val json1 = "{\"reason\" : \"business\",\"airport\" : \"SFO\"}"      <1>
val json2 = "{\"participants\" : 5,\"airport\" : \"OTP\"}"

new SparkContext(conf).makeRDD(Seq(json1, json2)).saveJsonToEs("spark/json-trips") <2>
----

<1> example of an entry within the +RDD+ - the JSON is _written_ as is, without any transformation
<2> index the JSON data through the dedicated +saveJsonToEs+ method

.Java
[source,java]
----
String json1 = "{\"reason\" : \"business\",\"airport\" : \"SFO\"}";  <1>
String json2 = "{\"participants\" : 5,\"airport\" : \"OTP\"}";

JavaContextSpark jsc = ...
JavaRDD<String><2> stringRDD = jsc.parallelize(ImmutableList.of(json1, json2));
JavaEsSpark.saveJsonToEs(stringRDD, "spark/json-trips");             <3>
----

<1> example of an entry within the +RDD+ - the JSON is _written_ as is, without any transformation
<2> notice the +RDD<String>+ signature
<3> index the JSON data through the dedicated +saveJsonToEs+ method

[float]
[[spark-write-dyn]]
==== Writing to dynamic/multi-resources

For cases when the data being written to {es} needs to be indexed under different buckets (based on the data content) one can use the `es.resource.write` field which accepts pattern that are resolved from the document content, at runtime. Following the aforementioned <<cfg-multi-writes,media example>>, one could configure it as follows:

.Scala

[source,scala]
----
val game = Map("media_type"<1>->"game","title" -> "FF VI","year" -> "1994")
val book = Map("media_type" -> "book","title" -> "Harry Potter","year" -> "2010")
val cd = Map("media_type" -> "music","title" -> "Surfing With The Alien")

sc.makeRDD(Seq(game, book, cd)).saveToEs("my-collection/{media-type}")  <2>
----

<1> Document _key_ used for splitting the data. Any field can be declared (but make sure it is available in all documents)
<2> Save each object based on its resource pattern, in this example based on +media_type+

For each document/object about to be written, {eh} will extract the +media_type+ field and use its value to determine the target resource.

.Java

As expected, things in Java are strikingly similar:

[source,java]
----
Map<String, ?> game = 
  ImmutableMap.of("media_type", "game", "title", "FF VI", "year", "1994");
Map<String, ?> book = ...
Map<String, ?> cd = ...

JavaRDD<Map<String, ?>> javaRDD = 
  jsc.parallelize(ImmutableList.of(game, book, cd));
saveToEs(javaRDD, "my-collection/{media-type}");  <1>
----

<1> Save each object based on its resource pattern, +media_type+ in this example

[float]
==== Reading data from {es}

For reading, one should define the {es} RDD that _streams_ data from {es} to Spark.

.Scala

Similar to writing, the +org.elasticsearch.spark+ package, enriches the +SparkContext+ API with +esRDD+ methods:

[source,scala]
----
import org.apache.spark.SparkContext    <1>
import org.apache.spark.SparkContext._

import org.elasticsearch.spark._        <2>

...

val conf = ...
val sc = new SparkContext(conf)         <3>

val rdd = sc.esRDD("radio/artists")     <4>
----

<1> Spark Scala imports
<2> {eh} Scala imports
<3> start Spark through its Scala API
<4> a dedicated `RDD` for {es} is created for index `radio/artists`

The method can be overloaded to specify an additional query or even a configuration `Map` (overriding `SparkConf`):

[source,scala]
----
...
import org.elasticsearch.spark._

...
val conf = ...
val sc = new SparkContext(conf)

sc.esRDD("radio/artists", "?me*") <1>
----

<1> create an `RDD` streaming all the documents matching `me*` from index `radio/artists`

The documents from {es} are returned, by default, as Scala http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/collections/overview.html[collections], namely one `Map[String, Any]`
for each document, where the keys represent the field names and the value their respective values.

.Java

Java users have a dedicated `RDD` that works the same as its Scala counterpart however it returns the documents as native, `java.util` collections.
Again by using +org.elasticsearch.hadoop.spark.api.java.JavaEsSpark+, _any_ +RDD+ can be saved to {es}:

[source,java]
----
import org.apache.spark.api.java.JavaSparkContext;   <1>
import org.elasticsearch.spark.java.api.JavaEsSpark; <2>
...

SparkConf conf = ...
JavaSparkContext jsc = new JavaSparkContext(conf);   <3>

JavaRDD<Map<String, Object>> esRDD = JavaEsSpark.esRDD(jsc, "radio/artists"); <4>
----

<1> Spark Java imports
<2> {eh} Java imports
<3> start Spark through its Java API
<4> a dedicated `RDD` for {es} is created for index `radio/artists`

in a similar fashion one can use the overloaded `esRDD` methods to specify a query or pass a `Map` object for advanced configuration.
Let us see how this looks like, but this time around using http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/static-import.html[Java static imports]:

[source,java]
----
import static org.elasticsearch.spark.java.api.JavaEsSpark.*;             <1>

...
JavaRDD<Map<String, Object>> esRDD = esRDD(jsc, "radio/artists", "?me*"); <2>
----

<1> statically import `JavaEsSpark` class
<2> create an `RDD` streaming all the documents starting with `me` from index `radio/artists`. Note the method does not have to be fully qualified due to the static import

By using the `JavaEsSpark` API, one gets a hold of Spark's dedicated `JavaRDD` which are better suited in Java environments than the base `RDD` (due to its Scala
signatures). Moreover, the dedicated RDD returns {es} documents as proper Java collections so one does not have to deal with Scala collections (which
is typically the case with ++RDD++s). This is particularly powerful when using Java 8, which we strongly advice as its 
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html[lambda expressions] make collection processing _extremely_
concise.

To wit, let us assume one wants to filter the documents from the RDD and return only those that contain a value that contain +mega+ (please ignore the fact one can and should do the filtering directly through {es}).

In versions prior to Java 8, the code would look something like this:
[source, java]
----
JavaRDD<Map<String, Object>> esRDD = esRDD(jsc, "radio/artists", "?me*");
JavaRDD<Map<String, Object>> filtered = esRDD.filter(
    new Function<Map<String, Object>, Boolean>() {
      @Override
      public Boolean call(Map<String, Object> map) throws Exception {
          for (Entry<String, Object> entry: map.entrySet()) {
              if (entry.getValue().toString().contains("mega")) {
                  return Boolean.TRUE;
              }
          }
          return Boolean.FALSE;
      }
    });
----

with Java 8, the filtering becomes a one liner:

[source,java]
----
JavaRDD<Map<String, Object>> esRDD = esRDD(jsc, "radio/artists", "?me*");
JavaRDD<Map<String, Object>> filtered = esRDD.filter(
                m -> m.values().stream().filter(v -> v.contains("mega")));
----


[[spark-mr]]
[float]
=== Using the {mr} layer

Another way of using Spark with {es} is through the {mr} layer, that is by leveraging the dedicate +Input/OuputFormat+ in {eh}. However, unless one is stuck on 
{eh} 2.0, we _strongly_ recommend using the native integration as it offers significantly better performance and flexibility.

[float]
==== Configuration

Through {eh}, Spark can integrate with {es} through its dedicated `InputFormat`, and in case of writing, through `OutputFormat`. These are described at length in the <<mapreduce, {mr}>> chapter so please refer to that for an in-depth explanation.

In short, one needs to setup a basic Hadoop +Configuration+ object with the target {es} cluster and index, potentially a query, and she's good to go.

From Spark's perspective, they only thing required is setting up serialization - Spark relies by default on Java serialization which is convenient but fairly inefficient. This is the reason why Hadoop itself introduced its own serialization mechanism and its own types - namely ++Writable++s. As such, +InputFormat+ and ++OutputFormat++s are required to return +Writables+ which, out of the box, Spark does not understand.
The good news is, one can easily enable a different serialization (https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo[Kryo]) which handles the conversion automatically and also does this quite efficiently.

[source,java]
----
SparkConf sc = new SparkConf(); //.setMaster("local");
sc.set("spark.serializer", KryoSerializer.class.getName()); <1>

// needed only when using the Java API
JavaSparkContext jsc = new JavaSparkContext(sc);
----

<1> Enable the Kryo serialization support with Spark

Or if you prefer Scala

[source,scala]
----
val sc = new SparkContext(...)
sc.set("spark.serializer", classOf[KryoSerializer].getName) <1>
----

<1> Enable the Kryo serialization support with Spark

Note that the Kryo serialization is used as a work-around for dealing with +Writable+ types; one can choose to convert the types directly (from +Writable+ to +Serializable+ types) - which is fine however for getting started, the one liner above seems to be the most effective.

[float]
==== Reading data from {es}

To read data, simply pass in the `org.elasticsearch.hadoop.mr.EsInputFormat` class - since it supports both the `old` and the `new` {mr} APIs, you are free to use either method on ++SparkContext++'s, +hadoopRDD+ (which we recommend for conciseness reasons) or +newAPIHadoopRDD+. Which ever you chose, stick with it to avoid confusion and problems down the road.

[float]
===== 'Old' (`org.apache.hadoop.mapred`) API

[source,java]
----
JobConf conf = new JobConf();                   <1>
conf.set("es.resource", "radio/artists");       <2>
conf.set("es.query", "?q=me*");                 <3>

JavaPairRDD esRDD = jsc.hadoopRDD(conf, EsInputFormat.class, 
                                        Text.class, MapWritable.class); <4>
long docCount = esRDD.count();
----

<1> Create the Hadoop object (use the old API)
<2> Configure the source (index)
<3> Setup the query (optional)
<4> Create a Spark RDD on top of {es} through `EsInputFormat` - the key represent the doc id, the value the doc itself

<2> Configure the source (index)
<3> Setup the query (optional)
<4> Create a Spark RDD on top of {es} through `EsInputFormat`

[float]
===== 'New' (`org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce`) API

As expected, the `mapreduce` API version is strikingly similar - replace +hadoopRDD+ with +newAPIHadoopRDD+ and +JobConf+ with +Configuration+. That's about it.

[source,java]
----
Configuration conf = new Configuration();       <1>
conf.set("es.resource", "radio/artists");       <2>
