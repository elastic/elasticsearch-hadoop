== Preface

{ehtm} is an `umbrella' project consisting of two similar, yet independent sub-projects with their own, dedicated, section in the documentation:

{eh} proper::
Interact with {es} from within a Hadoop environment. If you are using {mr}, Hive, Pig, {sp}, {st}, or Cascading, this
project is for you. For feature requests or bugs, please open an issue in the
https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-hadoop/issues[Elasticsearch-Hadoop repository].

repository-hdfs::
Use HDFS as a back-end repository for doing snapshot/restore from/to {es}. For more information, refer to its
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/master/repository-hdfs.html[home page]. For feature requests or
bugs, please open an issue in the https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues[Elasticsearch repository] with the
":Plugin Repository HDFS" tag.

Thus, while all projects fall under the Hadoop umbrella, each is covering a certain aspect of it so please be sure to read the appropriate documentation. For general questions around any of these projects, the https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch-and-hadoop[Elastic Discuss forum] is a great place to interact with other users in the community.
