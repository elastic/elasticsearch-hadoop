== Preface

{ehtm} is an `umbrella' project consisting of three similar, yet independent sub-projects with their own, dedicated, section in the documentation:

{ey}:: run {es} on top of YARN - see <<es-yarn>>

repository-hdfs:: use HDFS as a repository back-end; that is storage for doing snapshot/restore from/to {es}. For more information refer to its https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-hadoop/tree/master/repository-hdfs[home page]

{eh} proper:: interact with {es} from within a Hadoop environment. If you are using {mr}, Cascading, Hive, Pig, {sp} or {st}, this project is for you.


Thus, while all projects fall under the Hadoop umbrella, each is covering a certain aspect of it so please be sure to read the appropriate documentation.
