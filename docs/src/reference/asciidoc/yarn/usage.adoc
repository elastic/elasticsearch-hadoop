[[ey-usage]]
== Usage

{ey} allows through the command-line to provision, start, monitor and stop an {es} cluster inside a YARN environment.

Simply download elasticsearch-yarn-<version>.jar in a location of choice and make sure to have Hadoop/YARN available and configured in your classpath; double check through the `hadoop version` command:

[source,bash]
----
$ hadoop version

Hadoop 2.4.1
Subversion http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common -r 1604318
Compiled by jenkins on 2014-06-21T05:43Z
Compiled with protoc 2.5.0
From source with checksum bb7ac0a3c73dc131f4844b873c74b630
This command was run using /opt/share/hadoop/common/hadoop-common-2.4.1.jar
----

Once you have confirmed Hadoop is properly configured, do a basic sanity check for {ey} by invoking ++hadoop jar++:

[source,bash]
----
$ hadoop jar elasticsearch-yarn-<version>.jar
No command specified
Usage:
     -download-es  : Downloads Elasticsearch.zip
     -install      : Installs/Provisions Elasticsearch-YARN into HDFS
     -install-es   : Installs/Provisions Elasticsearch into HDFS
     -start        : Starts provisioned Elasticsearch in YARN
     -status       : Reports status of Elasticsearch in YARN
     -stop         : Stops Elasticsearch in YARN
     -help         : Prints this help

Configuration options can be specified _after_ each command; see the documentation for more information.
----

Each command should be self-explanatory. The typical usage scenario is:

[[yarn-es-download]]
[float]
=== Download the Elasticsearch version needed

This is a _one-time_ action; if you already have {es} at hand, deploy it under +downloads+ sub-folder. To wit:

[source,bash]
----
$ hadoop jar elasticsearch-yarn-<version> -download-es
Downloading Elasticsearch 1.6.0
Downloading ...........................................................................DONE
----

If you want to use a different version of {es}, you can specify so through the +es.version+ parameter (see the <<yarn-options>> section.

[[yarn-cfg-es]]
[float]
=== (Optional) Configuring {es}

If the default {es} is not suitable, for example certain plugins need to be installed or the storage path needs to be defined as mentioned <<ev-setup-storage,here>>, one should do so by modifying the {es} archive as it will serve as the blueprint of _all_ nodes installed within YARN.


[[yarn-provision-es]]
[float]
=== Provision {es} into HDFS

Now that we have downloaded {es}, let us upload it into HDFS so it becomes available to the Hadoop nodes.
This is another _one-time_ action (as long as your HDFS cluster and the target location remain in place):

[source,bash]
----
$ hadoop jar elasticsearch-yarn-<version>.jar -install-es

Uploaded /opt/es-yarn/downloads/elasticsearch-<version>.zip to HDFS at hdfs://127.0.0.1:50463/apps/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-<version>.zip
----

This command uploads the `elasticsearch-<version>.zip`  (that we just downloaded) to HDFS (based on the Hadoop configuration detected in the classpath) under `/apps/elasticsearch` folder. Again the location can be <<yarn-options, changed>> if needed.

Note that the uploaded ZIP can be configured accordingly to your setup - for example, one can include her own configuration (such as using a certain storage location) to override the defaults or for example certain plugins.
The zip acts as a template so be sure to include everything that need in it.

[[yarn-provision]]
[float]
=== Provision Elasticsearch-YARN into HDFS

Let us do the same _one-time_ command with the Elasticsearch-YARN jar:

[source,bash]
----
$ hadoop jar elasticsearch-yarn-<version>.jar -install

Uploaded opt/es-yarn/elasticsearch-yarn-<version>.jar to HDFS at hdfs://127.0.0.1:50463/apps/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-yarn-<version>.jar
----

You can verify the provisioning by interrogating HDFS either through the web console or +hadoop+ CLI:

[source,bash]
----
$ hadoop fs -ls /apps/elasticsearch
Found 2 items
-rw-r--r--   1 hdfs hdfs   30901787 2014-11-13 10:17 /apps/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-<version>.zip
-rw-r--r--   1 hdfs hdfs      52754 2014-11-13 16:16 /apps/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-yarn-<version>.jar
----

[[yarn-start]]
[float]
=== Start {es} on YARN

Once the necessary artifacts are in HDFS, one can start {es}:

[source,bash]
----
$ hadoop jar elasticsearch-yarn-<version>.jar -start
Launched a 1 node Elasticsearch-YARN cluster [application_1415813090693_0001@http://hadoop:8088/proxy/application_1415921358606_0001/] at Wed Nov 14 19:24:53 EET 2014
----

By default only a single node is created; to start multiple nodes use the +containers+ parameter (see <<yarn-options>> for more information):

[source,bash]
----
$ hadoop jar elasticsearch-yarn-<version>.jar -start containers=2
Launched a 2 nodes Elasticsearch-YARN cluster [application_1415921358606_0006@http://hadoop:8088/proxy/application_1415921358606_0006/] at Wed Nov 14 19:28:46 EET 2014
----

That's it!

[[yarn-status]]
[float]
=== Get status of {es} clusters in YARN

There are plenty of tools in Hadoop to check running YARN applications; with Elasticsearch YARN try the `-status` command:

[source,bash]
----
$ hadoop jar elasticsearch-yarn-<version>.jar -status
Id                              State       Status     Start Time         Finish Time        Tracking URL
application_1415921358606_0007  RUNNING     UNDEFINED  11/14/14 19:34 PM  N/A                http://hadoop:8088/proxy/application_1415921358606_0007/A
----

If you prefer the web ui, point your browser to the cluster console (typically on port 8088 - +http://hadoop:8088/cluster+) and the newly created {es} cluster, or rather
its +ApplicationMaster+ will show up:

image::yarn/img/yarn-app-list.png["AppManager List",align="center"]

One can inspect the containers manually by checking the container list (typically by accessing the +ApplicationManager+ UI):

image::yarn/img/yarn-container-list.png["Container List",align="center"]
You should be able to see the application and the associated containers marked as +RUNNING+ ; if that is not the case, check out the logs to see what is wrong.

[[yarn-stop]]
[float]
=== Stop {es} clusters in YARN

To shutdown your cluster, use the +-stop+ command:

[source,bash]
----
$ hadoop jar elasticsearch-yarn-<version>.jar -stop
Stopped Elasticsearch-YARN cluster with id application_1415921358606_0007 
----

[[yarn-options]]
[float]
=== Configuration

{ey} offers various knobs for tweaking its behavior - all can be passed as options after each command, overriding the default configuration. Multiple options can be specified (if you specify the same parameter multiple times, the last one wins):

[source,bash]
----
$ hadoop jar elasticsearch-yarn-<version>.jar [-command] [option.name]=[option.value] [option.name]=[option.value]
----

The following parameter are available:

+download.local.dir+ (default ./downloads/)::
Local folder where {ey} downloads remote artifacts (like +{es}.zip+)

+hdfs.upload.dir+ (default /apps/elasticsearch/)::
HDFS folder used for provisioning

+es.version+ (default 1.6.0)::
{es} version used for downloading, provisioning HDFS and running on the YARN cluster

+containers+ (default 1)::
The number of containers or {es} nodes for starting the cluster

+container.mem+ (default 2048)::
Memory requested for _each_ YARN container

+container.vcores+ (default 1)::
CPU cores requested for _each_ YARN container

+container.priority+ (default -1)::
YARN queue priority for each container

+env.<NAME>+::
Pattern for setting up environment variables on each container - each property starting with +env.+ prefix will be set remotely on _each_ container:
[source,bash]
----
$ hadoop jar elasticsearch-yarn-<version>.jar [-command] env.ES_USE_GC_LOGGING=true env.PROP=someValue
----
Sets up on each container two variables +ES_USE_GC_LOGGING+ and +PROP+.

+loadConfig+::
Property file to be loaded as configuration. That is, instead of specifying the options in each command, save them to a file and use that instead.
For example the above example, the two options (for setting the container environment variables) can be moved into a properties file 
[source,init]
----
# extra-cfg.properties
env.ES_USE_GC_LOGGING=true
env.PROP=someValue
----
and tell {ey} to load it:
[source,bash]
----
$ hadoop jar elasticsearch-yarn-<version>.jar [-command] loadConfig=extra-cfg.properties
----
