=== Known issues

* In 7.14.0, {esh} began preventing access to {es} clusters that did not include an `X-elastic-product` header in responses in order to
ensure that {esh} was working with an {es} cluster that it was compatible with. See
https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-hadoop/issues/1672[#1672] for more information about this. However if the case of the
`X-elastic-product` header name sent from {es} is changed (for example if it is lower-cased) by an intermediary between {es} and {esh} (for
example, the http proxy for cloud.elastic.co), then {esh} ignores the header and will reject the response as not being from a valid {es}
cluster.

We have fixed this issue in {esh} 7.14.2 and later versions. For more details,see
https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-hadoop/issues/1745[#1745].
