= Breaking Changes

Generally, we strive to maintain backwards compatibility between minor
versions (e.g. 5.x to 5.7) so that upgrades can be done without any code
or configuration changes, but breaking changes do manifest between major
versions (e.g. 5.x to 6.y).

For clarity, we always list any breaking changes at the top of the
<<release-notes,release notes>> for each version.

[[breaking-changes-5.5]]
=== Breaking Changes in 5.5

This section discusses the changes that you should be aware of if you
upgrade Elasticsearch from version 5.4 to 5.5.

==== Removed Deprecated

In 5.5, Elasticsearch has removed a deprecated way of checking the existance
of types. ES-Hadoop was previously using this deprecated endpoint up until
the 5.4.x releases. If you have upgraded to Elasticsearch 5.5.0, you will
need to upgrade ES-Hadoop to version 5.5.0.

The new endpoint is available since Elasticsearch 5.x. In case you are running
Elasticsearch 2.x, the correct endpoint will be used.

[[breaking-changes-5.0]]
=== Breaking Changes in 5.0

This section discusses the changes that you should be aware of if you
upgrade ES-Hadoop from version 2.x to 5.x.

==== Supported Hadoop Versions

ES-Hadoop 5.0 has added support for new versions of software from the Hadoop
ecosystem. Support for older versions is normally dropped during these cycles
for the purposes of stability and to allow for cleanup of older code. Please
note the following version compatibility changes in 5.0:

* Support for Hive 0.13 and 0.14 has been removed. These versions of Hive are
known to have serious issues that have since been repaired in 1.0. Hive 1.0 has
been released for a while and a majority of distributions have already
switched to it. Hive 1.0 will continue to be supported by ES-Hadoop 5.0.
* With the addition of support for Storm 1.x, support for Storm 0.9 has been removed due to backwards compatibility issues.
* Support for SparkSQL 1.0-1.2 has been removed. SparkSQL was originally
released in Spark 1.0-1.2 as an alpha, but has since become stable in Spark
1.3 with a drastically changed API. Additionally, we have added support for
Spark 2.0, which is binary-incompatible with previous versions of Spark.
Instead of supporting three different version compatibilities of Spark at the
same time we have decided to drop support for Spark SQL 1.0-1.2.

==== Names of Included Spark Jars in ES-Hadoop

With the removal of support for Spark 1.0-1.2 and the addition of support for
Spark 2.0, the names of all the Spark artifacts included in ES-Hadoop 5.0
have changed. All Spark artifacts in this release now have both of their
Spark and Scala versions explicitly demarcated in their names (instead of
just Scala and _sometimes_ Spark).

|==========================================================

==== HDFS Repository
In 5.0, the HDFS Repository plugin has been all but re-built from the ground up to allow for compatibility with the changes to security policies in Elasticsearch's plugin framework.

===== Code has Moved
In 5.0, the Repository HDFS plugin https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/master/plugins/repository-hdfs[has been moved]
to the https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch[main Elasticsearch project].
The documentation page in the elasticsearch-hadoop repository has been
updated with a header signaling this move.

===== Security
Disabling the Java SecurityManager in Elasticsearch is no longer required for the HDFS Repository plugin to function. Elasticsearch 5.0 requires all plugins to operate properly with the configured SecurityManager. The plugin was heavily modified to allow for compatibility with this new constraint. This should allow you to maintain a secured Elasticsearch instance while still using HDFS as a location for storing snapshots.

===== Changes in Configurations
Due to constraints in the underlying security system as well as changes to
the way the plugin functions, the following configurations have been removed
in 5.0 with no replacement options:

* `concurrent_streams`
* `user_keytab`
* `user_principal`
* `user_principal_hostname`

===== Supported Versions
Previously, the HDFS Repository supported both Apache Hadoop 1.x (default)
and Apache Hadoop 2.x through two distributions. In 5.0, there is now only
one distribution which is built against the latest Apache Hadoop 2.x (at this
time 2.7.1). The distribution for Apache Hadoop 1.x has been removed.

===== Version ++light++ removed
Even if Hadoop is already installed on the Elasticsearch nodes, for security
reasons, the required libraries need to be placed under the plugin folder.
Because of this, the `light` distribution of the repository plugin which
contained no Hadoop client dependencies is no longer available in 5.0.

===== Strict Query Parsing
In previous versions, users were able to specify options that modify search
properties in Query DSL strings provided to the client. In some cases these
properties would conflict with how the framework executed searches during
read operations. In 5.0, when specifying a Query DSL string, if a `query` field
is present, its contents are extracted and all other contents are discarded
(such as `source` or `size`). If there is no `query` field, the entire text
is nested inside of the `query` field during execution.
