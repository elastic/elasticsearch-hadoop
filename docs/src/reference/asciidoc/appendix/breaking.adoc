= Breaking Changes

Generally, we strive to maintain backwards compatibility between minor
versions (e.g. 5.x to 5.7) so that upgrades can be done without any code
or configuration changes, but breaking changes do manifest between major
versions (e.g. 5.x to 6.y).

For clarity, we always list any breaking changes at the top of the
<<release-notes,release notes>> for each version.

[[breaking-changes-6.0]]
=== Breaking Changes in 6.0

This section discusses the changes that you should be aware of if you
upgrade ES-Hadoop from version 5.x to 6.x.

==== Configuration Changes
`es.update.script` has been deprecated in favor of the new `es.update.script.
inline` option. The `es.update.script` configuration will continue to function
as a legacy configuration with the same meaning as `es.update.script.inline`.

==== Pattern Formatting in Index and Type Names

Coming soon in 6.0 is the removal of multiple types per index. All project
tests were migrated to using single types where possible. This migration
unearthed a problem with Pig and Cascading in regards to how those frameworks
interact with the provided index/type names. During setup, Pig and Cascading
attempt to parse these index names as paths, and when the index has a formatted
pattern in it (like `index-{event:yyyy.MM.dd}/type`) the path parsing breaks.
Going forward, the colon character `:` that delimits the field name from the
format will be changed to the pipe character `|`. An example of the new patterned
index names is `index-{event|yyyy.MM.dd}/type`. 5.x will support both separators,
but will log a deprecation message when a colon `:` is encountered.

==== TTL and Timestamp Meta-fields

Elasticsearch 6.0 is seeing the removal of the TTL and Timestamp meta-fields from
being allowed on document index and update requests. Because of this, we will be
removing the ability to specify them in 6.0 and deprecating their usage in 5.x.

==== Hadoop 1.x Support

As of 6.0.0 we will no longer be testing on Hadoop 1.x versions. These versions
have been considered end of life for quite a while. While the connector may
continue to work for those versions, we no longer officially support them.
Use these versions at your own risk!

==== YARN Integration Discontinued

Due to the limitations in YARN for support of long running processes, we have decided
to cease development and discontinue the YARN integration in ES-Hadoop. We thank the
community for participating in the beta. If you have any questions or concerns about
this, please feel free to discuss them on our https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch-and-hadoop[forums].

==== Default Supported Scala Version is now 2.11

In 6.0.0, our ES-Hadoop jar will ship with Spark compiled against Scala 2.11 by default. We will
continue to support Scala 2.10 in compatibility artifacts, but the main project
artifact will target Scala 2.11 by default.

[[breaking-changes-5.0]]
=== Breaking Changes in 5.0

This section discusses the changes that you should be aware of if you
upgrade ES-Hadoop from version 2.x to 5.x.

==== Supported Hadoop Versions

ES-Hadoop 5.0 has added support for new versions of software from the Hadoop
ecosystem. Support for older versions is normally dropped during these cycles
for the purposes of stability and to allow for cleanup of older code. Please
note the following version compatibility changes in 5.0:

* Support for Hive 0.13 and 0.14 has been removed. These versions of Hive are
known to have serious issues that have since been repaired in 1.0. Hive 1.0 has
been released for a while and a majority of distributions have already
switched to it. Hive 1.0 will continue to be supported by ES-Hadoop 5.0.
* With the addition of support for Storm 1.x, support for Storm 0.9 has been removed due to backwards compatibility issues.
* Support for SparkSQL 1.0-1.2 has been removed. SparkSQL was originally
released in Spark 1.0-1.2 as an alpha, but has since become stable in Spark
1.3 with a drastically changed API. Additionally, we have added support for
Spark 2.0, which is binary-incompatible with previous versions of Spark.
Instead of supporting three different version compatibilities of Spark at the
same time we have decided to drop support for Spark SQL 1.0-1.2.

==== Names of Included Spark Jars in ES-Hadoop

With the removal of support for Spark 1.0-1.2 and the addition of support for
Spark 2.0, the names of all the Spark artifacts included in ES-Hadoop 5.0
have changed. All Spark artifacts in this release now have both of their
Spark and Scala versions explicitly demarcated in their names (instead of
just Scala and _sometimes_ Spark).

|==========================================================

==== HDFS Repository
In 5.0, the HDFS Repository plugin has been all but re-built from the ground up to allow for compatibility with the changes to security policies in Elasticsearch's plugin framework.

===== Code has Moved
In 5.0, the Repository HDFS plugin https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/master/plugins/repository-hdfs[has been moved]
to the https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch[main Elasticsearch project].
The documentation page in the elasticsearch-hadoop repository has been
updated with a header signaling this move.

===== Security
Disabling the Java SecurityManager in Elasticsearch is no longer required for the HDFS Repository plugin to function. Elasticsearch 5.0 requires all plugins to operate properly with the configured SecurityManager. The plugin was heavily modified to allow for compatibility with this new constraint. This should allow you to maintain a secured Elasticsearch instance while still using HDFS as a location for storing snapshots.

===== Changes in Configurations
Due to constraints in the underlying security system as well as changes to
the way the plugin functions, the following configurations have been removed
in 5.0 with no replacement options:

* `concurrent_streams`
* `user_keytab`
* `user_principal`
* `user_principal_hostname`

===== Supported Versions
Previously, the HDFS Repository supported both Apache Hadoop 1.x (default)
and Apache Hadoop 2.x through two distributions. In 5.0, there is now only
one distribution which is built against the latest Apache Hadoop 2.x (at this
time 2.7.1). The distribution for Apache Hadoop 1.x has been removed.

===== Version ++light++ removed
Even if Hadoop is already installed on the Elasticsearch nodes, for security
reasons, the required libraries need to be placed under the plugin folder.
Because of this, the `light` distribution of the repository plugin which
contained no Hadoop client dependencies is no longer available in 5.0.

===== Strict Query Parsing
In previous versions, users were able to specify options that modify search
properties in Query DSL strings provided to the client. In some cases these
properties would conflict with how the framework executed searches during
read operations. In 5.0, when specifying a Query DSL string, if a `query` field
is present, its contents are extracted and all other contents are discarded
(such as `source` or `size`). If there is no `query` field, the entire text
is nested inside of the `query` field during execution.
