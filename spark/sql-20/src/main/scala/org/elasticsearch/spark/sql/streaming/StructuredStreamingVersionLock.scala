/**
 * Spark Structured Streaming just recently left "Experimental" mode in Spark 2.2.0. Its underlying interfaces have not
 * been subject to the same stability rules as other parts of the project since its debut in 2.0.0. Each point release
 * between 2.0 and 2.2 has introduced breaking changes to the api. This means that even though our 2.x artifact supports
 * all 2.0 and up versions of Spark, we need to ensure that users of Spark Structured Streaming are running on
 * Spark 2.2.0 and above and are not confused about why their streaming jobs are failing if they use versions of Spark
 * that do not match what we can reasonably support.
